  abstract = {Mangroves are disappearing rapidly worldwide despite their well documented biodiversity and the ecosystem services they provide. Failure to link ecological processes and their societal benefits has favored highly destructive aquaculture and tourism developments that threaten mangroves and result in costly ``externalities.'' Specifically, the potentially irreparable damage to fisheries because of mangrove loss has been belittled and is greatly underestimated. Here, we show that, in the Gulf of California, fisheries landings are positively related to the local abundance of mangroves and, in particular, to the productive area in the mangrove{\textendash}water fringe that is used as nursery and/or feeding grounds by many commercial species. Mangrove-related fish and crab species account for 32\% of the small-scale fisheries landings in the region. The annual economic median value of these fisheries is US \$37,500 per hectare of mangrove fringe, falling within the higher end of values previously calculated worldwide for all mangrove services together. The ten-year discounted value of one hectare of fringe is {$>$}300 times the official cost set by the Mexican government. The destruction of mangroves has a strong economic impact on local fishing communities and on food production in the region. Our valuation of the services provided by mangroves may prove useful in making appropriate decisions for a more efficient and sustainable use of wetlands.},

  abstract = {Octopus fisheries are important at the southwest coast of Madagascar. Fishermen traditionally dried and sold octopus in the local market. Recently, an international company has developed a new lucrative market for the octopus. It has led to an increase in the value and exploitation of this species. Increase in fishing intensity has resulted in an over exploitation of the stock. The aim of this study was to find out the current situation of the fishery and the possibilities for economic improvement for the fishery. A bioeconomic model developed by Arnason was used to describe the fishery. The model has calculated the profitability of the fishery and the state of the stock. The results from the fishery indicate that actual fishing effort (no. of fishermen) is about three times more than required to earn maximum sustainable economic benefits from the octopus fishery. There is no management in place so this indicates the need of a fisheries management system. Several types of management are proposed to alleviate the fisheries and community fishing right will be likely appropriate to this fishery. This report also will study the possible implementation of this community management.},

The observed and anticipated changes in global climate present significant opportunities and challenges for societies and economies. We compare the vulnerability of 132 national economies to potential climate change impacts on their capture fisheries using an indicator-based approach. Countries in Central and Western Africa (e.g. Malawi, Guinea, Senegal, and Uganda), Peru and Colombia in north-western South America, and four tropical Asian countries (Bangladesh, Cambodia, Pakistan, and Yemen) were identified as most vulnerable. This vulnerability was due to the combined effect of predicted warming, the relative importance of fisheries to national economies and diets, and limited societal capacity to adapt to potential impacts and opportunities. Many vulnerable countries were also among the world's least developed countries whose inhabitants are among the world's poorest and twice as reliant on fish, which provides 27\% of dietary protein compared to 13\% in less vulnerable countries. These countries also produce 20\% of the world's fish exports and are in greatest need of adaptation planning to maintain or enhance the contribution that fisheries can make to poverty reduction. Although the precise impacts and direction of climate-driven change for particular fish stocks and fisheries are uncertain, our analysis suggests they are likely to lead to either increased economic hardship or missed opportunities for development in countries that depend upon fisheries but lack the capacity to adapt.},

  abstract = {This review assesses the degree of resilience of mangrove forests to large, infrequent disturbance (tsunamis) and their role in coastal protection, and to chronic disturbance events (climate change) and the future of mangroves in the face of global change. From a geological perspective, mangroves come and go at considerable speed with the current distribution of forests a legacy of the Holocene, having undergone almost chronic disturbance as a result of fluctuations in sea-level. Mangroves have demonstrated considerable resilience over timescales commensurate with shoreline evolution. This notion is supported by evidence that soil accretion rates in mangrove forests are currently keeping pace with mean sea-level rise. Further support for their resilience comes from patterns of recovery from natural disturbances (storms, hurricanes) which coupled with key life history traits, suggest pioneer-phase characteristics. Stand composition and forest structure are the result of a complex interplay of physiological tolerances and competitive interactions leading to a mosaic of interrupted or arrested succession sequences, in response to physical/chemical gradients and landform changes. The extent to which some or all of these factors come into play depends on the frequency, intensity, size, and duration of the disturbance. Mangroves may in certain circumstances offer limited protection from tsunamis; some models using realistic forest variables suggest significant reduction in tsunami wave flow pressure for forests at least 100 m in width. The magnitude of energy absorption strongly depends on tree density, stem and root diameter, shore slope, bathymetry, spectral characteristics of incident waves, and tidal stage upon entering the forest. The ultimate disturbance, climate change, may lead to a maximum global loss of 10e15\% of mangrove forest, but must be considered of secondary importance compared with current average annual rates of 1e2\% deforestation. A large reservoir of below-ground nutrients, rapid rates of nutrient flux and microbial decomposition, complex and highly efficient biotic controls, selfdesign and redundancy of keystone species, and numerous feedbacks, all contribute to mangrove resilience to various types of disturbance.},

  abstract = {We present a model of a fish population present on two patches connected by migrations. Fish grow logistically on each patch and are caught. We assume that migrations between the two sites are fast relative to local growth and fishing. Taking advantage of the time scales, we use methods of aggregation of variables to obtain a reduced model governing the total biomass of the fish population at a slow time scale. We are looking for the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) for the system of the two connected patches. We show that although the total equilibrium population may be greater than the sum of the carrying capacities on each isolated site, the total catch is always less than or equal to the sum of the catches on the isolated fishing sites. We then consider a prey{\textendash}predator community of fish in the same environment. We assume that only the predator is caught and not its prey, growing logistically on each site. We study the Lotka{\textendash}Volterra prey{\textendash}predator model as well as the model with a type II Holling functional response. We show that the total catch at MSY of the system of connected sites can be greater than the sum of the captures on each isolated site. This result is obtained when a fishing site with a large prey carrying capacity and an average growth rate is connected to a site with a small carrying capacity but a large growth rate. Finally, we discuss fishery management methods on two fishing sites for the Lotka{\textendash}Volterra model as well as the Holling type II model in the case of a prey refuge.},

More than 80\% of Indonesian fish catches are from small-scale fishery. Hence, it is crucial to investigate the performance of small-scale fisheries in relation to the sustainable fish exploitation. The purpose of this study is to calculate fisheries degradation rate to show the resource exploitation trend in Indonesian small-scale fisheries. We focus on small-scale fisheries that use hook and line and gillnet to catch Eastern little tuna, Skipjack tuna, Red snappers, Blue line sea bass, and Halibut. The fisheries degradation rate shows the fish resources depletion caused by fishing. The fisheries degradation rate had trend to reach the threshold score with the average coefficient of 0.33 in ten years. This means that Indonesian small-scale fisheries lead to high fish exploitation. We recommend that the Indonesian government improve regulation of the small-scale fishing activities by limiting the fishing days and gears used, so the activities become sustainable.},

Analysis of intra-community social stratifications in relation to participation in conservation is important to the pursuit of environmental justice as well as improved efficacy of a given con\- servation intervention. While a large body of literature broadly examines intra and inter-community dynamics in relation to community-based conservation, few have specifically quantified how wealth influences one's participation in community-based conservation initiatives, especially in the marine realm. To address these questions, we interviewed people living near marine conservation initiatives in Madagascar. Using a principle component analysis, we created an asset-based wealth index and showed that both knowledge of and partici\- pation in marine conservation was positively correlated with wealth. Specifically, three of the four participation categories were statistically correlated with wealth, including involvement in any element of the conservation project, involvement in decision-making, and in enforcement. However, wealth was not significantly correlated with participation in monitoring. Ultimately our research highlights the importance of understanding underlying drivers of participation in community-based conservation. If the poorest in a community are underrepresented in local participation, the conservation initiative will not only be unjust, but will also likely be less effective.},

In this review, we analyze the ways in which social processes have been integrated into Marxan, a spatially explicit reserve design planning tool. Drawing on 89 peer-reviewed articles published 2005-2020, we analyze the ways in which human activity, values, and processes are spatialized in the environment; something we call socialscape ecology. To quantify this, we used nine categories including three count categories (social costs, targets, and parameters) and six rank categories (reliance on proxies versus direct observation, integration of temporal change, inclusion of sea tenure, analysis across scale, provisioning analysis, and stakeholder participation). We show that remarkably little change occurred over time across eight of the nine categories. One exception to this was an increase in number of studies that integrated temporal variation in their analysis. Ultimately, we argue that greater attention to and integration of social processes and variables into Marxan will improve marine managers' understanding of not only the ecological but also the social, cultural and political processes that influence the social and ecological success of marine conservation efforts.},

Humans act as a major vector for the spread of these pests via firewood transport, although existing models do not explicitly capture human decision-making regarding firewood transport. In this paper we present a two-patch coupled human-environment system model that includes social influence and long-distance firewood transport and examines potential strategies for mitigating pest spread. We found that increasing concern regarding infestations (f) significantly reduced infestation. Additionally it resulted in multiple thresholds at which the intensity of infestation in a patch was decreased. It was also found that a decrease in the cost of firewood purchased in the area where it is supposed to be burned (Cl) resulted in an increased proportion of local-firewood strategists, and a 67\% decrease in Cl from \$6.75 to \$4.50 was sufficient to eliminate crosspatch infestation. These effects are synergistic: increasing concern through awareness and education campaigns acts together with reduced firewood costs, thereby reducing the required threshold of both awareness and economic incentives. Our results indicate that the best management strategy includes a combination of public education paired with firewood subsidization.},

Results show that ethnicity significantly influences social network structure and is responsible for a homophily effect, which can create challenges for stakeholder collaboration across groups. Our analysis also suggests that ethnicity influences the formation of diverse network structures, and can affect the level of linkages to outside industry leaders, government or management officials, and members of the scientific community.

These transitions are often preceded by characteristic early warning signals such as increased system variability. However, early warning signals in complex, coupled human{\textendash}environment systems (HESs) remain little studied. Here, we compare critical transitions and their early warning signals in a coupled HES model to an equivalent environment model uncoupled from the human system. We parameterize the HES model, using social and ecological data from old-growth forests in Oregon. We find that the coupled HES exhibits a richer variety of dynamics and regime shifts than the uncoupled environment system. Moreover, the early warning signals in the coupled HES can be ambiguous, heralding either an era of ecosystem conservationism or collapse of both forest ecosystems and conservationism. The presence of human feedback in the coupled HES can also mitigate the early warning signal, making it more difficult to detect the oncoming regime shift. We furthermore show how the coupled HES can be ``doomed to criticality'': Strategic human interactions cause the system to remain perpetually in the vicinity of a collapse threshold, as humans become complacent when the resource seems protected but respond rapidly when it is under immediate threat. We conclude that the opportunities, benefits, and challenges of modeling regime shifts and early warning signals in coupled HESs merit further research.},

  abstract = {Immunization programs have often been impeded by vaccine scares, as evidenced by the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) autism vaccine scare in Britain. A ``free rider'' effect may be partly responsible: vaccine-generated herd immunity can reduce disease incidence to such low levels that real or imagined vaccine risks appear large in comparison, causing individuals to cease vaccinating. This implies a feedback loop between disease prevalence and strategic individual vaccinating behavior. Here, we analyze a model based on evolutionary game theory that captures this feedback in the context of vaccine scares, and that also includes social learning. Vaccine risk perception evolves over time according to an exogenously imposed curve. We test the model against vaccine coverage data and disease incidence data from two vaccine scares in England \& Wales: the whole cell pertussis vaccine scare and the MMR vaccine scare. The model fits vaccine coverage data from both vaccine scares relatively well. Moreover, the model can explain the vaccine coverage data more parsimoniously than most competing models without social learning and/or feedback (hence, adding social learning and feedback to a vaccine scare model improves model fit with little or no parsimony penalty). Under some circumstances, the model can predict future vaccine coverage and disease incidence{\textemdash}up to 10 years in advance in the case of pertussis{\textemdash}including specific qualitative features of the dynamics, such as future incidence peaks and undulations in vaccine coverage due to the population's response to changing disease incidence. Vaccine scares could become more common as eradication goals are approached for more vaccine-preventable diseases. Such models could help us predict how vaccine scares might unfold and assist mitigation efforts.},

  abstract = {There exists an interplay between vaccine coverage, disease prevalence and the vaccinating behaviour of individuals. Moreover, because of herd immunity, there is also a strategic interaction between individuals when they are deciding whether or not to vaccinate, because the probability that an individual becomes infected depends upon how many other individuals are vaccinated. To understand this potentially complex interplay, a game dynamic model is developed in which individuals adopt strategies according to an imitation dynamic (a learning process), and base vaccination decisions on disease prevalence and perceived risks of vaccines and disease. The model predicts that oscillations in vaccine uptake are more likely in populations where individuals imitate others more readily or where vaccinating behaviour is more sensitive to changes in disease prevalence. Oscillations are also more likely when the perceived risk of vaccines is high. The model reproduces salient features of the time evolution of vaccine uptake and disease prevalence during the whole-cell pertussis vaccine scare in England and Wales during the 1970s. This suggests that using game theoretical models to predict, and even manage, the population dynamics of vaccinating behaviour may be feasible.},

We present an analysis of the O. cyanea catch data for the first two years of temporary closures based on landings data collected from village-based octopus collectors. We found a significant closure effect in terms of total weight and number of octopus caught on opening days, but observed that these benefits dissipated quickly, returning to pre-closure levels within days. Mean octopus size increased by 41\% on average when compared to data from selected control sites. However, extremely high levels of fishing effort on opening days meant that these biological effects did not translate into increased weight of octopus caught per successful fisher over the opening tide. Upon opening of concurrent closures during the second round of closures we found significant increases in the weight of octopus caught per successful fisher. We conclude that the pilot closures had a significant closure effect, but caution against isolated openings leading to concentrated fishing effort on opening days.},

  abstract = {Large-scale fishing closures are a leading tool in the spatial management of global ocean resources. This is exemplified in the U.S. Atlantic sea scallop (Placopecten magellanicus) fishery which uses a rotational scheme of temporary closed areas in both offshore and nearshore waters. The closed areas are generally hundreds to thousands square kilometers, but a group of inshore commercial scallop harvesters were interested in the effect of closing a much smaller area (3 km2), which had sustained valuable harvest before recent poor yields. To describe changes in scallop abundance and size within and around this closure, two independent surveys, a drop camera and diver transect, were conducted through industry{\textendash}academic collaboration. In addition, this unusual union of a predominately offshore method, the drop camera, and inshore method, divers, was used to better interpret the results of each method. The drop camera survey results suggested that the closure significantly increased the biomass of exploitable scallops, showing that even closure orders of magnitude smaller than commonly used for scallops can be effective. Although the dive survey did not show this, understanding the uncertainties of each method helped resolve this discrepancy. Drop camera densities were calculated from a broader spatial area more representative of the entire area with increased sample size. By contrast, the dive survey provided an intensive description of scallops at each individual survey site. Combining a drop camera survey with dive stations to collect scallop measurements would provide densities from a spatial scale representative of the study area while improving shell height frequency estimation and providing biological data. In addition, this project demonstrated how stakeholder engagement supported by academic institutions and fishery managers can allow intensive monitoring of small fishery closed areas outside of government assessments.},

It is argued that lack of such social-ecological fit makes governance and conservation difficult, yet progress in explicitly defining and rigorously testing what constitutes a good fit has been limited. We used a novel modeling approach and data from case studies of fishery and forest conservation to empirically test presumed relationships between conservation outcomes and certain patterns of alignment of social-ecological interdependences. Our approach made it possible to analyze conservation outcome on a systems level while also providing information on how individual actors are positioned in the complex web of social-ecological interdependencies. We found that when actors who shared resources were also socially linked, conservation at the level of the whole socialecological system was positively affected. When the scales at which individual actors used resources and the scale at which ecological resources were interconnected to other ecological resources were aligned through tightened feedback loops, conservation outcome was better than when they were not aligned. The analysis of individual actors' positions in the web of social-ecological interdependencies was helpful in understanding why a system has a certain level of social-ecological fit. Results of analysis of positions showed that different actors contributed in very different ways to achieve a certain fit and revealed some underlying difference between the actors, for example in terms of actors' varying rights to access and use different ecological resources.},

It has even been shown that social networks can be more important than the existence of formal institutions for effective enforcement and compliance with environmental regulations. However, all social networks are not created equal. On the contrary, the structural pattern of relations (i.e. the topology) of a social network can have significant impact on how actors actually behave. This clearly has implications for actors' abilities to manage environmental challenges. This review aims to add more precision to initial insights and pending hypotheses about the positive impacts of social networks on governance processes and outcomes, by reviewing and synthesizing empirically based literature explicitly studying structural characteristics of social networks in natural resource governance settings. It is shown that significant differences in governance processes and outcomes can be expected among networks experiencing structural differences in terms of density of relations, degree of cohesiveness, subgroup interconnectivity, and degree of network centralization. Furthermore, the review shows that none of these structural characteristics present a monotonically increasing positive effect on processes of importance for resource governance, and that favoring one characteristic likely occurs at the expense of another. Thus, assessing the most favorable level and mix of different network characteristics, where most of the positive governance effects are obtained while undesired effects are minimized, presents a key research and governance challenge.},

The success of this strategy is reduced if the released fish are temporarily invulnerable to capture due to behavioral changes, as recent research suggests. Here, we explore how temporary fishing closures with short openings might be used in CR fisheries to increase the catch-related utility associated with angler satisfaction from catches. We simulated generic fisheries in single-lake and multiple-lake systems and found that regular, temporary closures could increase catch-related utility{\textemdash}but predominately under the key assumption that angler satisfaction increases disproportionately with increasing catch rates. In the multiple-lake case, a strategy of rotating temporary closures could provide greater catch-related utility than continuously open fisheries, but this would depend upon anglers' willingness to redistribute effort from closed waters to open waters. A key implication of these results is that even in CR fisheries, effort limitation may be necessary to provide quality angling opportunities. Our results also emphasize the importance of understanding how vulnerable pool dynamics can differ across fisheries and potentially interact with other processes and mechanisms that drive the observed changes in catchability and catch rates.},

We report here that disturbed mangrove area showed a loss of 20\% of benthic biodiversity, with the local extinction of four Phyla (Cladocera, Kynorincha, Priapulida, Tanaidacea), a loss of 80\% of microbial-mediated decomposition rates, of the benthic biomass and of the trophic resources. The results of this study strengthen the need to preserve mangrove forests and to restore those degraded to guarantee the provision of goods and services needed to support the biodiversity and functioning of wide portions of tropical ecosystems.},

Using a structural foresight modeling approach, this paper examines past, present, and future trends of fish supply and demand in Africa to highlight challenges and prospects of the fish sector's contribution to food security in the continent. If historical trends are maintained, growth of aquaculture and fisheries would be slow, resulting in declining per capita fish consumption. Alternative scenarios highlight the potential importance of African aquaculture development in addressing food security. Policies to promote sustainable aquaculture, reduce post-harvest losses, and facilitate fish trade are indispensable. Fish deserves more attention in food and nutrition policies due to its prominence in the African food basket.},

  abstract = {Information about small-scale fisheries (SSF) is often scarce and scattered. This is partly due to insufficient attention on this sector, whose contribution to society is often assumed to be negligible. It also results from SSF being highly diverse, with complex patterns of harvest and post-harvest activities taking place in a wide range of aquatic environments and often in remote areas. Existing fisheries information systems fail to fully capture the characteristics and essence of SSF, resulting in a lack of integrated and up-to-date data, which further marginalizes the sector in policymaking and governance. To help rectify the situation, the Too Big To Ignore project developed the Information System on Small-scale Fisheries (ISSF), a Web-based, open data portal to collect and disseminate knowledge on various aspects of SSF. This paper describes the conception of ISSF and its key features, and presents some results extracted from the analysis of ISSF data, illustrating the importance of such a global database on SSF.},

  abstract = {Despite their contribution to employment, food security, poverty eradication, and community well-being, small-scale fisheries often find themselves in a disadvantageous position globally relative to large-scale fisheries and other industries competing for marine space, resources, and government attention. By and large, small-scale fisheries are marginalized in every sense of the word: culturally, socially, economically, geographically, legally, and politically. Their unfavorable status is frequently perceived to be both a cause and effect of overfishing, unsustainable fishing practices, and governance failure; thus, their potential to modernize while participating in and delivering on sustainable development goals is less than optimal. Given that the majority of the world's fisheries are small-scale, it is imperative that major changes take place in the conditions that determine the predicament of small-scale fisheries. For these reasons, in 2014, FAO member states endorsed the Voluntary Guidelines for Securing Sustainable Small-Scale Fisheries in the Context of Food Security and Poverty Eradication (SSF Guidelines), with the aim of encouraging states and civil society organizations to take steps to bring about the changes needed to improve the sustainability and viability of small-scale fisheries. The SSF Guidelines call for broad and complex governance interventions; however, as much as they can help create transformation within small-scale fisheries, governance systems themselves must also be transformed before real change can take place. Based on the analysis of 34 case studies of small-scale fisheries' governance around the world, our synthesis reveals that small-scale fisheries' governance is indeed undergoing different types of transformation and can take place in all governing modes. Further, these transformations occur at the operational, institutional, and the meta-levels of governance, which, from the perspective of the SSF Guidelines, is encouraging.},

Building resilient social-ecological systems requires approaches that are robust to uncertainty and to regime shifts. Harvesting diverse portfolios of natural resources and adapting portfolios in response to change could stabilize economies reliant on natural resources and their markets, both of which are prone to unpredictable shifts. Here we use fisheries catch and revenue data from Alaskan fishing communities over 34 years to test whether diversification and turnover in the composition of fishing opportunities increased economic stability during major ocean and market regime shifts in 1989. More than 85\% of communities show reduced fishing revenues following these regime shifts. However, communities with the highest portfolio diversity and those that could opportunistically shift the composition of resources they harvest, experienced negligible or even positive changes in revenue. Maintaining diversity in economic opportunities and enabling turnover facilitates sustainability of communities reliant on renewable resources facing uncertain futures.},

Temporal, non-permanent, rotational or periodically harvested area closures have been employed across the Indo-Pacific for centuries and are a common measure within contemporary community-based and co-management frameworks. Although prior evidence suggests that periodic closures may confer fisheries benefits for some taxa or in certain conditions, there is little evidence that they are equally effective for the sustainable management of the many types of small-scale fisheries important in the Indo-Pacific. Case studies of periodic closures are reviewed to highlight the variations in target species, harvesting periodicity and fishing pressure that will influence the fisheries management effectiveness of this tool. Fisheries management benefits are observed for short-lived, fast-growing taxa or for a range of taxa in low fishing pressure situations. Stocks declines are observed for long-lived taxa or for a range of taxa if harvesting is intense. It is argued that community-based and co-management policy and action must better account for these factors when promoting and implementing periodic closures for medium- to long-term fisheries management or conservation goals.},

But empirical information on movement, space use, and connectivity is lacking for many species, and data acquisition is often hindered when study animals cross international borders. The African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) exemplifies such species that require vast undisturbed areas to support viable, self-sustaining populations. To study wild dog dispersal and investigate potential barriers to movements and causes of mortality during dispersal, between 2016 and 2019 we followed the fate of 16 dispersing coalitions (i.e., same-sex group of {$\geq$}1 dispersing African wild dogs) in northern Botswana through global positioning system (GPS)-satellite telemetry. Dispersing wild dogs covered {$\leq$}54 km in 24 hours and traveled 150 km to Namibia and 360 km to Zimbabwe within 10 days. Wild dogs were little hindered in their movements by natural landscape features, whereas medium to densely human-populated landscapes represented obstacles to dispersal. Human-caused mortality was responsible for {$>$}90\% of the recorded deaths. Our results suggest that a holistic approach to the management and conservation of highly mobile species is necessary to develop effective research and evidence-based conservation programs across transfrontier protected areas, including the need for coordinated research efforts through collaboration between national and international conservation authorities. {\copyright} 2020 The Wildlife Society.},

We mapped the social network used for communication of knowledge and information related to natural resource extraction among villagers in a coastal seascape in Kenya. We further identified subgroups and examined their interrelations while measuring to what extent personal attributes such as occupation can explain observed group structure. Finally, we compared the local ecological knowledge held by villagers of different occupations with the structure of the communication network to map how well this structure can explain distribution of ecological knowledge among them. Results show that communication occurs primarily between fishermen who use the same gear type, which may inhibit exchange of ecological knowledge within the community. This may partly explain why the community has been unsuccessful in regulating resource extraction, especially since potentially influential groups of nonfishermen have a limited communication with the various fisher groups. Analysis of network structure also shows that groups most central, and hence potentially most influential, are dominated in numbers by migrant deep sea fishermen, hypothetically less motivated to initiate collective action for resource management. Hence, we conclude that a lack of collective action to remedy an unsustainable situation may be attributed to various different but distinct aspects of the specific structure of the social network.},

Octopus               exhibits a large individual variability in growth and the exponential growth curve is the best fitting theoretical model among other usual models tested. Globally, the growth rates were comparable in the sea and in tanks. Growth rates for the hot season were lower than those for the cold season. Applied to               in situ               data, the statistical tests showed that females grow more quickly than males. Life expectancy was estimated at between 12 and 14 months. These results question the previous growth curves for the region, all of which were obtained from modal analysis using size or weight{\textendash}frequencies and were used during stock assessments of this important resource off the north-west African coast.},

The methods are used increasingly when studying various aspects of science and also in the way institutions and universities are ranked worldwide. A sufficient number of studies have been completed, and with the resulting literature, it is now possible to analyse the bibliometric method by using its own methodology. The bibliometric literature in this study, which was extracted from Web of Science, is divided into two parts using a method comparable to the method of Jonkers et al. (Characteristics of bibliometrics articles in library and information sciences (LIS) and other journals, pp. 449{\textendash}551, 2012: The publications either lie within the Information and Library Science (ILS) category or within the non-ILS category which includes more applied, ``subject'' based studies. The impact in the different groupings is judged by means of citation analysis using normalized data and an almost linear increase can be observed from 1994 onwards in the non-ILS category. The implication for the dissemination and use of the bibliometric methods in the different contexts is discussed. A keyword analysis identifies the most popular subjects covered by bibliometric analysis, and multidisciplinary articles are shown to have the highest impact. A noticeable shift is observed in those countries which contribute to the pool of bibliometric analysis, as well as a self-perpetuating effect in giving and taking references.},

  abstract = {Octopuses are a difficult resource to manage due to their short life span, rapid growth, high natural mortality and sensitivity to environmental conditions. These biological traits result in seasonal fluctuations in abundance and subsequent landings. Twenty two octopus fisheries were reviewed from 17 countries to examine the application and effectiveness of different management measures for consideration in the Tasmanian Octopus pallidus fishery in Australia. While the most commonly used measures in these fisheries were input controls, particularly seasonal closures and minimum size limits, these controls are poorly suited to semelparous, holobenthic octopuses such as Octopus pallidus. A semelparous reproductive strategy means that minimum size limits don't allow animals to reproduce prior to capture. A holobenthic life history strategy means that fishery-wide seasonal closures are unable to address variation in biological characteristics (e.g. size at maturity) across sub-stocks and collectively reduce effort on vulnerable life stages. Seasonal closures and minimum size limits also reduce the economic efficiency of the fleet and may diminish fishery productivity through effort displacement and serial depletion. A rotational system of effort or cap on total effort that provides flexibility to fishers and effectively spreads fishing effort, allowing different areas or sub-stocks to recover, could be a more effective option for achieving the objectives of most octopus fisheries.},

  abstract = {Fisheries that target fish spawning aggregations can exhibit hyperstability, in which catch per unit effort (CPUE) remains elevated as stock abundance declines, but empirical support is limited. We compiled several fishery-dependent and fishery-independent data sets to assess stock trends in the barred sand bass (Paralabrax nebulifer) and the kelp bass (Paralabrax clathratus) in southern California, USA, evaluate the interaction between spawning aggregations and fishing activities, and test for hyperstability. Annual and seasonal trends from fisheries and population data indicate that regional stocks of both species have collapsed in response to overfishing of spawning aggregations and changes in environmental conditions. The aggregating behavior of fish and persistent targeting of spawning aggregations by recreational fisheries combined to produce a hyperstable relationship between CPUE and stock abundance in both species, which created the illusion that population levels were stable and masked fishery collapses. Differences in the rate of decline between the two species may be related to the size, duration, and spatial distribution of their spawning aggregations. Results of this study provide empirical evidence of hyperstability in aggregation-based fisheries and demonstrate that CPUE data be used with caution and given low weight when fishery-independent data are available.},

Based on fieldwork in the municipality of Balabac in Palawan province, western Philippines, this paper takes stock of this trend, and investigates the implications of the relationship between Chinese patterns of luxury seafood consumption and the intensification of coastal livelihoods in Southeast Asia. The paper focuses mostly on the trade in live reef fish, with reference also to sea cucumber and shark fin. In the light of recent discussions of social and environmental change in Southeast Asia, the paper addresses how the intensification of coastal livelihoods has manifested in important trends, including an increasing reliance on high-value commodity fisheries such as the trade in luxury seafood. Important consequences of this intensification of coastal livelihoods include environmental degradation, and social change due to the development of broader trading networks. The paper argues that the live reef fish for food trade is an important contemporary livelihood that highlights the ways in which Chinese consumption is having diverse social and environmental consequences for source countries in Southeast Asia.},

  abstract = {Migration presents challenges and opportunities for both origin and destination communities. It should be emphasized that much of the migration discourse has only focused on the origin more than the destination. Hence, the dramatic changes in the flow of migrants across international borders, as well as accelerating internal movements of rural migrants in the direction of the cities are practically reshaping our world. It is a truism that agriculture and human advancement are keys to addressing the fundamental causes of migration. According to (FAO, 2018), over half of the populace in the least developed countries will still live in rural areas in the year 20150. Three-quarters of the extreme poor base their livelihoods on agriculture or other rural activities. In the African continent, Eleven million young people will enter the labor market every year for the next ten years. Thus, agriculture can be categorized as the backbone of human subsistence and its stanchion for human existence surpasses any other area of endeavor. It provides employment to individuals and business support to organizations. However, despite its importance, there has been a continuous reduction in the number of people directly involved in agriculture, especially in developing countries. In Nigeria for example, the attraction to the city which is the `Pull factor'', white-collared jobs, price instability, income instability, herdsmen/farmer crisis, general insecurity, government intervention among others have reduced the number of people participating directly in agriculture. Economic issues such as deficit in trade, uncertain availability of food, generation of income, poverty reduction and creation of employment could be catered by the government by enacting pro-agricultural laws and providing incentives in various forms which includes provisions agricultural technology, tax reliefs, easy access to loans, security of lives and livestock, infrastructural development, irrigation trenches in desert areas, supply of fertilizers, control of usage of insecticides. Nigeria should come up with effective, pragmatic and workable agricultural plan and policy to harness the massive possibility of agricultural commercialization to fulfil the internal consumption demands and also for the purpose of export. There is also the need to process raw materials into finished products. For many smallholder farmers and herders, moving away from rural areas is an attractive opportunity to diversify livelihoods, escape slow-outbreak events which include climate change and degeneration of the environment, seek improved social services, and reunite with family members. This paper will interrogate instances of policies in receiving countries that empower the displaced and capitalize on opportunities that can arise from a global population shift. This research paper assesses the relationship between migration, human development, and agriculture and also raises and answers question on how we can enhance the development potential of migration in order to achieve zero hunger. Therefore, this paper concludes with the prospects and limitations of commercialization of agriculture and provides suggestions of ways for advancement using Nigeria as an example. It also seeks to suggest ways to make agriculture more vibrant and robust, which if attained, will reduce reliance on oil and gas as the predominantly sources of revenue generation.},

One class of these methods requires only catch time series and, in some cases, information about life history or fishery characteristics, to estimate stock status. These catch-only methods (COMs) range from statistical models trained on data-rich stocks to mechanistic population models that make assumptions about changes in fishing effort. We review 11 COMs, comparing performance through application to data-rich stocks and simulated fisheries. The catch-only methods evaluated here produce imprecise and biased estimates of B/BMSY, especially for stocks that are lightly exploited. They were also generally poor classifiers of stock status. While no method performed best across all stocks, ensembles of multiple COMs generally performed better than individual COMs. We advocate for testing new COMs using this common platform. We also caution that performance in estimating stock status is not sufficient for gauging the usefulness of COMs in managing fisheries. Greater use of management strategy evaluation is needed before COMs can be considered a reliable tool for management.},

While fisheries are widely considered a male-dominated industry, women play a significant and vital role in the survival of small-scale family-run fisheries and are frequently the driving force of innovation, diversification, and the development of new markets. However, these roles are often unseen {\textendash} with the male fishers being the registered beneficiary and performer of more visible tasks. Although several fisheries studies have focused on gender, no study has yet considered or contextualized the impact of Fisheries Local Action Groups (FLAGs) on both the visibility and empowerment of women. Drawing on a quantitative survey of 113 FLAGs and the qualitative case study of three EU fisheries areas, this paper explores these factors. While the results show that FLAGs are active in supporting women in diversification activities, the findings highlight that their impact on women's empowerment is complex, varies between areas, and that interventional programs play an important role in identifying gender issues in fisheries areas and how they impact their transformation and survival.},

It has been suggested that the dynamics of multi agent learning can be studied using replicator equations from population biology. Most existing studies so far have been limited to discrete strategy spaces with a small number of available actions. In many cases, however, the choices available to agents are better characterized by continuous spectra. This paper suggests a generalization of the replicator framework that allows to study the adaptive dynamics of Q-learning agents with continuous strategy spaces. Instead of probability vectors, agents' strategies are now characterized by probability measures over continuous variables. As a result, the ordinary differential equations for the discrete case are replaced by a system of coupled integral-differential replicator equations that describe the mutual evolution of individual agent strategies.

We describe the LMMA's context and history, and highlight aspects of our approach that we feel underpin its outcomes, including: (a) comanagement rather than communitymanagement; (b) the permanent field presence of a supporting NGO; (c) a management focus on locally important natural resources; (d) the implementation of poverty alleviation initiatives aimed at reducing barriers to management; (e) decision-making by resource users rather than scientists; (f) a diversified, entrepreneurial funding model; and (g) an emphasis on monitoring and adaptive management. We also highlight several challenges, including: (a) the inability to influence fishery supply chains; (b) promoting participation and good governance; (c) promoting rule application; (d) standing up to outsiders; (e) promoting environmental management in the long term; and (f) maintaining funding. Our experiences suggest that small scale fishers can be effective natural resource managers in low-income contexts, but may need extended support from outsiders; however, the role of supporting NGO is nuanced and complex.},

Using Chile as a case study, we designed a market-based program aimed at improving fishers' livelihoods while incentivizing the establishment and enforcement of no-take areas within areas managed with territorial user right regimes. Building on explicit enabling conditions (i.e., high levels of governance, participation, and empowerment), we used a place-based, human-centered approach to design a program that will have the necessary support and buy-in from local fishers to result in landscape-scale biodiversity benefits. Transactional infrastructure must be complex enough to capture the biodiversity benefits being created, but simple enough so that the program can be scaled up and is attractive to potential financiers. Biodiversity benefits created must be commoditized, and desired behavioral changes must be verified within a transactional context. Demand must be generated for fisher-created biodiversity benefits in order to attract financing and to scale the market model. Important design decisions around these 3 components{\textemdash}supply, transactional infrastructure, and demand{\textemdash}must be made based on local social-ecological conditions. Our market model, which is being piloted in Chile, is a flexible foundation on which to base scalable opportunities to operationalize a scheme that incentivizes local, verifiable biodiversity benefits via conservation behaviors by fishers that could likely result in significant marine conservation gains and novel cross-sector alliances.},

Here we explore social, political, and ecological aspects of a transformation in governance of Chile's coastal marine resources, from 1980 to today. Critical elements in the initial preparatory phase of the transformation were (               i               ) recognition of the depletion of resource stocks, (               ii               ) scientific knowledge on the ecology and resilience of targeted species and their role in ecosystem dynamics, and (               iii               ) demonstration-scale experimental trials, building on smaller-scale scientific experiments, which identified new management pathways. The trials improved cooperation among scientists and fishers, integrating knowledge and establishing trust. Political turbulence and resource stock collapse provided a window of opportunity that triggered the transformation, supported by new enabling legislation. Essential elements to navigate this transformation were the ability to network knowledge from the local level to influence the decision-making processes at the national level, and a preexisting social network of fishers that provided political leverage through a national confederation of artisanal fishing collectives. The resultant governance scheme includes a revolutionary national system of marine tenure that allocates user rights and responsibilities to fisher collectives. Although fine tuning is necessary to build resilience of this new regime, this transformation has improved the sustainability of the interconnected social{\textendash}ecological system. Our analysis of how this transformation unfolded provides insights into how the Chilean system could be further developed and identifies generalized pathways for improved governance of marine resources around the world.},

The same species can be fully protected or heavily harvested on different sides of a border. This can generate a source{\textendash}sink dynamic from the areas with lower to those with higher mortality, a process known as compensatory immigration. We tested this hypothesis on the wolverine (Gulo gulo) population of southern Scandinavia, which is shared between two countries: Sweden and Norway. Wolverines are fully protected in Sweden, but subject to intensive population regulation in Norway. Using non-invasive genetic sampling and capture{\textendash}recapture modeling, we analyzed the dynamics of wolverine survival and emigration patterns between 2002 and 2013. Wolverines in Norway experienced a lower survival than in Sweden. Migration across the national border was directed towards movements from Sweden to Norway. There was a functional relationship between harvest rate in Norway and emigration rates across the national border, both at the individual and population level, thus confirming the compensatory immigration hypothesis. Contrasting management regimes within the same population can generate undesired demographic and spatial dynamics, jeopardize conservation goals on the two sides of a border, and reduce the efficiency of management actions. This calls for the adoption of a coordinate population approach in large carnivore conservation and management. Failing to do so can cause a waste of the already limited resources allocated for large carnivore conservation, and it might hinder effective conflict mitigation.},

Based on biological records, the secondary spread of the European green crab Carcinus maenas has maintained a relatively consistent rate of advance for over 100 yr, covering a wide range of temperate latitudes and local hydrological environments along the Atlantic coast of North America. We employed a discrete-time model to investigate the green crab's spreading speed and the relationship between demography and dispersal. The model is an age-structured integro-difference equation that couples a matrix for population growth and a dispersal kernel for spread of individuals within a season. The choice of a Normal or Laplace distribution for the dispersal kernel has only a minimal effect on the spreading speed. Our modeling exercise illustrates that there are many realistic combinations of vital rates (fecundity and survival) and dispersal rates that give rise to a given spreading speed c*. Further, our results indicate that the invasion speed is most sensitive to the standard deviation of larval dispersal, followed by recruitment rate (a demographic parameter that combines fecundity, larval survival, and juvenile survival), and least sensitive to adult survival. We thus enhance understanding of invasion biology, specifically the relative importance of demography versus dispersal distance for marine species with a pelagic larval stage. We also provide insights on and rank possible management strategies.},

When effective, LMMAs can encourage responsible fishing, strengthen compliance and improve adaptive capacity, and may help to safeguard food security, address coastal poverty and increase resource sustainability. However, evidence that LMMAs can achieve long-term biological goals is limited. Here, we used a six-year dataset and a before-after-control-impact sampling design to assess the bio\- logical effectiveness of five community-managed no take zones (CMNTZs) situated within the Velondriake LMMA in southwest Madagascar. Linear mixed-effect models revealed that the difference in biomass between control and reserve sites increased over time. Significant differences in biomass between CMNTZs and controls were only evident from year two onwards, with 189\% more total biomass in CMNTZs than fished control sites by year six. There was no effect of CMNTZs on the biomass of fish families preferentially targeted by the local fishery, limiting the long-term fisheries benefits of this reserve network unless individual CMNTZs are made larger to accommodate the home ranges of fishery targeted families. There were however, reserve effects preventing the decline of untargeted fish families and species richness.},

We review the state of knowledge of mangrove vulnerability and responses to predicted climate change and consider adaptation options. Based on available evidence, of all the climate change outcomes, relative sea-level rise may be the greatest threat to mangroves. Most mangrove sediment surface elevations are not keeping pace with sea-level rise, although longer term studies from a larger number of regions are needed. Rising sea-level will have the greatest impact on mangroves experiencing net lowering in sediment elevation, where there is limited area for landward migration. The Pacific Islands mangroves have been demonstrated to be at high risk of substantial reductions. There is less certainty over other climate change outcomes and mangrove responses. More research is needed on assessment methods and standard indicators of change in response to effects from climate change, while regional monitoring networks are needed to observe these responses to enable educated adaptation. Adaptation measures can offset anticipated mangrove losses and improve resistance and resilience to climate change. Coastal planning can adapt to facilitate mangrove migration with sea-level rise. Management of activities within the catchment that affect long-term trends in the mangrove sediment elevation, better management of other stressors on mangroves, rehabilitation of degraded mangrove areas, and increases in systems of strategically designed protected area networks that include mangroves and functionally linked ecosystems through representation, replication and refugia, are additional adaptation options.},

  abstract = {Temporary closures have been used for centuries in many parts of the world as a tool for fisheries management and restoration. The length of time that a closure is in place can play a determinative role in the effectiveness of the closure as a means of restoring stock biomass and diversity. For species that are slow growing and slow to reproduce, closures shorter than a decade are unlikely to be sufficient for the effects of restoration to accrue. New Zealand has two legislative mechanisms specifically designed to establish temporary closures: sections 186A and 186B of the Fisheries Act 1996. These provisions were created to respond to localised depletion and to provide for the use and management practices of M{\=a}ori (New Zealand's Indigenous People). There is currently a two-year time limit on temporary closures applied for by the community. By defining a time limit for temporary closures legislators have failed to account for the ecology of many of the species targeted for protection that require longer periods of protection for restoration. Furthermore, the way in which the final decision making power is vested with central government is also inconsistent with the original purpose of the provisions. An amendment to the temporary closure provisions is suggested to provide greater flexibility for users and to better recognise the non-commercial fishing rights provided for by the Fisheries Act 1996, of local communities seeking to apply this tool.},

We employ a novel network theoretical approach to assess the different forms of collaboration, including cross-scale collaboration. We find that the social network predisposes cross-scale collaboration for invasive animal control, an action where coordination of activities is necessary. We find that for revegetation activities there is little evidence of collaboration across scales, but this could be fostered by a subset of stakeholders acting in a ``scale-bridging'' role. Addressing this will likely improve the effectiveness of revegetation efforts and the outcomes of the broader conservation initiative.},

Previous modelling approaches have focused primarily on local and/or global scales, while regional scale models have been relatively few. In this study, regional scale predictive habitat models are presented for deep-sea corals for the U.S. West Coast (California, Oregon and Washington). Model results are intended to aid in future research or mapping efforts and to assess potential coral habitat suitability both within and outside existing bottom trawl closures (i.e. Essential Fish Habitat (EFH)) and identify suitable habitat within U.S. National Marine Sanctuaries (NMS). Deep-sea coral habitat suitability was modelled at 500 m6500 m spatial resolution using a range of physical, chemical and environmental variables known or thought to influence the distribution of deep-sea corals. Using a spatial partitioning cross-validation approach, maximum entropy models identified slope, temperature, salinity and depth as important predictors for most deep-sea coral taxa. Large areas of highly suitable deep-sea coral habitat were predicted both within and outside of existing bottom trawl closures and NMS boundaries. Predicted habitat suitability over regional scales are not currently able to identify coral areas with pin point accuracy and probably overpredict actual coral distribution due to model limitations and unincorporated variables (i.e. data on distribution of hard substrate) that are known to limit their distribution. Predicted habitat results should be used in conjunction with multibeam bathymetry, geological mapping and other tools to guide future research efforts to areas with the highest probability of harboring deep-sea corals. Field validation of predicted habitat is needed to quantify model accuracy, particularly in areas that have not been sampled.},

Overall, the trajectories indicated that anticyclonic activity was mostly observed on the western side of the Channel, with cyclonic activity being more prevalent in the east. A lack of eddy activity was noted in the southeast corner of the Channel (i.e. SW of Madagascar). Drifter behaviour illustrated that surface water from the Comoros Basin, entrained into anticyclonic eddies during formation, can be retained and isolated for months whilst being transported southwards through the Channel. During a tropical cyclone weather event, a drifter was observed to switch between counter-rotating eddies indicating that horizontal mixing of the Ekman layer does occur. The drifters also illustrated and emphasised the flow field and transport between eddies (i.e. the interstitial flow) in the Mozambique Channel. Despite the dominance of southward propagating anticyclones, drifters were able to move north and south through the Channel in the frontal flow field between eddies within periods of 51{\textendash}207 days. Cross-channel transport in both directions between the Madagascan and Mozambique shelf regions was similarly observed, with time spans of 19{\textendash}30 days. Surprisingly, drifters from the southern limb of the East Madagascar Current were transported westward across the channel to the Mozambique shelf. This transport was similarly facilitated by the frontal flow field between eddies. It is hypothesised that the frontal zones between eddies and interstitial waters play an important role in distributing biota in the Mozambique Channel.},

  abstract = {Large carnivores are important ecological drivers of ecosystem dynamics when they occur at ecologically effective densities. They are also challenging to conserve, especially in transboundary settings such as along borders of parks and protected areas. Here, we tested for effects of transboundary movements on survival of 72 radiocollared gray wolves from 1987 to 2018 in and adjacent to Banff National Park, Canada. We fit Bayesian countingprocess survival models to known-fate radiotelemetry data and tested for the influence of intrinsic covariates such as sex and age, time, and movements outside of protected areas on survival of wolves. We also estimated cause-specific mortality. Non-parametric survival was 0.733 (95\% CI 0.622e0.816), and the top Bayesian survival model indicated that wolves outside the park had much lower annual survival rates (0.44, 95\% BCI {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.24e0.65) compared to wolves inside the park (0.84, 95\% BCI {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.73e0.91). The cumulative risk of mortality was on average 6.7 times higher (odds ratio 95\% BCI {$\frac{1}{4}$} 2.2e21.4) for wolves outside the park, peaking during the winter hunting and trapping seasons. We found weak evidence for declining survival over time, opposite to patterns predicted by densitydependence. Bayesian cause-specific mortality indicated that the top three sources of mortality were trapping (rate {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.080, 36\% of mortality), followed by hunting (0.053, 18\%), and highway (0.046, 18\%) mortality. Surprisingly, we found no intraspecific mortality, and low dispersal from Banff National Park. This demographic profile is akin to other exploited populations across North America. While we were unable to combine survival rates with reproduction to estimate population trends, the overall mortality rates within our study area are consistent with a stable wolf population. Nonetheless, the long-term stability and ecological effectiveness of wolves likely differed inside and outside of protected areas, which highlights a challenge with managing transboundary carnivores exposed to different management regimes.},

This natural mosaic ecosystem is thought to reflect alternative stable states driven by threshold responses of recruitment to fire and moisture regimes. The role of adaptive human behavior in such systems remains understudied, despite its pervasiveness and the fact that such ecosystems can exhibit complex dynamics. We develop a nonlinear mathematical model of coupled human{\textendash}environment dynamics in mosaic systems and social processes regarding conservation and economic land valuation. Our objective is to better understand how the coupled dynamics respond to changes in ecological and social conditions. The model is parameterized with southern Brazilian data on mosaic ecology, land-use profits, and questionnaire results concerning landowner preferences and conservation values. We find that the mosaic presently resides at a crucial juncture where relatively small changes in social conditions can generate a wide variety of possible outcomes, including complete loss of mosaics; large-amplitude, long-term oscillations between land states that preclude ecosystem stability; and conservation of the mosaic even to the exclusion of agriculture/silviculture. In general, increasing the time horizon used for conservation decision making is more likely to maintain mosaic stability. In contrast, increasing the inherent conservation value of either forests or grasslands is more likely to induce large oscillations{\textemdash}especially for forests{\textemdash}due to feedback from rarity-based conservation decisions. Given the potential for complex dynamics, empirically grounded nonlinear dynamical models should play a larger role in policy formulation for human{\textendash}environment mosaic ecosystems.},

Yet despite its exploitation and importance in many artisanal fisheries throughout the world, little is known about its life history, ecology and vulnerability. We used stylet increment analysis to age a wild O. cyanea population for the first time and gonad histology to examine their reproductive characteristics. O. cyanea conforms to many cephalopod life history generalisations having rapid, non-asymptotic growth, a short life-span and high levels of mortality. Males were found to mature at much younger ages and sizes than females with reproductive activity concentrated in the spring and summer months. The female dominated sex-ratios in association with female brooding behaviours also suggest that larger conspicuous females may be more prone to capture and suggests that this intertidal octopus population has the potential to be negatively impacted in an unregulated fishery. Size at age and maturity comparisons between our temperate bordering population and lower latitude Tanzanian and Hawaiian populations indicated stark differences in growth rates that correlate with water temperatures. The variability in life history traits between global populations suggests that management of O. cyanea populations should be tailored to each unique set of life history characteristics and that stylet increment analysis may provide the integrity needed to accurately assess this.},

However, the extent to which people are able to harness those benefits depends not only on the supply of ecosystem services but also on their capacity to access them via a range of social, economic, and institutional mechanisms. Here, we examine how people perceive ecosystem service benefits across 28 coral reef fishing communities in four countries. We quantitatively show that bundles of benefits are mediated by key access mechanisms (e.g., rights-based, economic, knowledge, social, and institutional). Interestingly, social, institutional, and knowledge mechanisms were associated with the greatest number and diversity of benefits. Resource managers can focus on these access mechanisms to maximize ecosystem service benefits while minimizing human{\textendash}environment impacts.           ,              Ecosystem services are supplied by nature but, by definition, are received by people. Ecosystem service assessments, intended to influence the decisions people make regarding their interactions with nature, need to understand how people benefit from different ecosystem services. A critical question is therefore, What determines the distribution of ecosystem service benefits between different sections of society? Here, we use an entitlements approach to examine how people perceive ecosystem service benefits across 28 coral reef fishing communities in four countries. In doing so, we quantitatively show that bundles of benefits are mediated by key access mechanisms (e.g., rights-based, economic, knowledge, social, and institutional). We find that specific access mechanisms influence which ecosystem services people prioritize. Social, institutional, and knowledge mechanisms are associated with the largest number and diversity of benefits. However, local context strongly determines whether specific access mechanisms enable or constrain benefits. Local ecological knowledge enabled people to prioritize a habitat benefit in Kenya, but constrained people from prioritizing the same benefit in Madagascar. Ecosystem service assessments, and their resultant policies, need to include the broad suite of access mechanisms that enable different people to benefit from a supply of ecosystem services.},

Methods for assessing the effects on target stocks are generally well developed, but methods for assessing the effects on other components and attributes of the ecosystem are not. Area closures and effort controls are widely used fishery management tools that affect the distribution of fishing effort and may therefore have consequences for a range of species and habitats. An approach is developed to predict the effects of area closures and effort control on the biomass, production, and species richness of benthic communities in the North Sea. The redistribution of beam trawling effort as a result of management action was modelled with a random utility model, assuming that fishers selected fishing grounds on the basis of their knowledge of past catch rates. The effects of trawling on benthic invertebrates were predicted using a size-based model that accounted for differences in habitat among fishing grounds. Our simulations demonstrated that closures of different sizes and in different locations could have positive or negative effects on benthic communities. These predicted effects resulted from the trade-off between recovery in the closed areas and additional trawling effects in the open areas that arose from displaced fishing activity. In the absence of effort controls, closure of lightly fished areas had the strongest positive effect on benthic communities. Effort reduction also had a positive effect. Therefore, area closures in lightly fished areas, coupled with effort reduction, are expected to minimize the effects of fishing on benthic communities. As it was not possible to access full international data for the North Sea beam trawl fleet, the results of the analyses are illustrative rather than complete. Nevertheless, what is demonstrated is an effective approach for assessing the environmental consequences of fishery management action that can be used to inform management decision-making as part of an EAF.},

  abstract = {Carbonate hardparts of marine organisms are frequently explored archives of their ambient seawater composi\- tion. Among the various materials used, the hardparts of molluscs are particularly relevant because their accretionary growth allows for the compilation of time-resolved proxy data sets. Here, we explore to which extent the calcium isotope values of aragonitic cephalopod hardparts represent proxies for seawater composition or record a trophic level signal. In a first step, we collect Ca isotope data from a diverse set of modern cepha\- lopods, including Nautilus, Sepia and Spirula. These taxa differ in their external/internal hardparts, life spans, trophic levels, habitat depth, hinterland geology, and resulting runoff. In a second step, we have put these concepts to the test and explore the calcium isotope signatures of Lower Cretaceous (lower Albian) wellpreserved cephalopods (nautiloids, ammonoids and belemnites) and bivalve shells from Madagascar. In the sense of a methodological comparison, two measurement approaches (double spike ({$\delta$}44/40Ca, TIMS) and bracketing standard ({$\delta$}44/42Ca, MC-ICP-MS) techniques are applied. Calcium from organic matter and intra-shell variations on bulk {$\delta$}44/40Ca isotope values are explored. Four protocols (H2O2, NaOH, HClO4, incineration up to 250 ◦C including subsequent rinsing with deionised water and Ca removal) are applied to destroy organic matter in the shell material and to dissolve any non-carbonate bound Ca, i.e., its metastable secondary Ca reservoir. These are equally successful, and the Ca isotope values of the purified carbonate phase plot on the equilibrium mass fractionation line. Samples not treated to destroy or remove their organic matter do not fall on the equi\- librium mass fractionation line. Limitations of sample pre-treatment are reflected by a slight shift towards lower values in the case of incineration experiments at 650 ◦C. This feature is best explained in the context of a mineralogical phase transformation of aragonite to calcite. Calcium isotope values show no significant variability when sampling hardparts with different microstructures (callus, nacre, prismatic layer) and mineralised during different ontogenetic phases (outer shell, septa). Perhaps most relevant, mean {$\delta$}44/40Ca (‰ SRM-915a) isotope values for Nautilus (0.72‰ {$\pm$}0.19 2SD), Sepia (0.79‰ {$\pm$}0.18 2SD), and Spirula (0.50‰ {$\pm$}0.18 2SD) lack evidence for a significant control by trophic levels. Nitrogen isotope data and known diets for all three cephalopods serve as a litmus test for these data, which do not correlate with this dietary proxy information. These results are considered encouraging and suggest that Ca isotope values of cephalopod shells are proxies for their ambient seawater Ca isotope signatures. According to our data, however, it remains unclear to which extend cephalopod hardparts record the Ca isotopic composition of past seawater. Specifically, the data from three different modern species point to a mean {$\Delta$}44/40Ca(ceph-seawater) fractionation of - 1.21‰ ({$\pm$} 0.15 2SD). Based on our work, we present a best practice guide for cephalopod Ca isotope analysis and interpretation.},

However, MPAs implemented worldwide include a large variety of zoning and management schemes from single to multiple-zoning and from no-take to multiple-use areas. The current IUCN categorisation of MPAs is based on management objectives which many times have a significant mismatch to regulations causing a strong uncertainty when evaluating global MPAs effectiveness. A novel global classification system for MPAs based on regulations of uses as an alternative or complementing the current IUCN system of categories is presented. Scores for uses weighted by their potential impact on biodiversity were built. Each zone within a MPA was scored and an MPA index integrates the zone scores. This system classifies MPAs as well as each MPA zone individually, is globally applicable and unambiguously discriminates the impacts of uses.},

Here, the results of the first two closures of an octopus No-Take Zone (NTZ) in the region, based on fisheries data collected between September 2003 and June 2006 are presented. The results show that the number and mean weight of octopus caught increased significantly after closure periods of the NTZ. However, the high intensity of fishing on the opening days reduced the potential longer term benefits of the first NTZ closure, and a reduction in fishing pressure on the second opening lead to longer-lasting benefits. This study demonstrates that seasonal, temporary closures of fishing sites are potentially a strong management tool in maintaining the sustainability of a traditional octopus fishery. The active participation and support of the local fishers was key to the success in the implementation and respect of the NTZ.}

  abstract = {Management of highly migratory fish species is generally assumed to require complicated international agreements. The effects of spatial closures for such species are thought to be diluted by their extensive movements. We tested these assumptions using a case study of striped marlin (Kajikia audax) fisheries off of Baja California, Mexico. Beginning in 1977, Mexico instituted a series of long-line fishery closures and closed areas to reduce commercial fishing mortality rates on billfishes. Using data from the Japanese long-line fishery and the recreational billfish fishery in a stock reduction analysis (SRA) model, we show that temporary closures of Mexico's EEZ to long-lining from 1977{\textendash}1980 and 1984{\textendash}1985 had a rapid effect on local abundance of striped marlin. Regional striped marlin abundance likely increased by 12{\textendash}22\% following the 4-year closure and 6{\textendash}12\% following the 2-year closure. Increases near Baja California may have been larger. Recreational catch-and-release appears to have a more modest effect because catches in the recreational fishery are substantially smaller than historic long-line catches. A 100\% release rate over the 10-year period for which recreational catch data were available would likely have increased regional abundance by 2.8{\textendash}7.5\% relative to no recreational release. There is also evidence for a small effect of the El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on recruitment or net immigration, with stronger recruitment or net immigration during the cooler La Ni{\~n}a phase.},

  abstract = {Mangrove forests deliver incredible ecosystem goods and services and are enormously relevant to sustainable living. An accurate assessment of the global status of mangrove forests warrants the necessity of datasets with sufficient information on spatial distributions and patch patterns. However, existing datasets were mostly derived from \$30 m resolution satellite imagery and used pixel-based image classification methods, which lacked spatial details and reasonable geo-information. Here, based on Sentinel-2 imagery, we created a global mangrove forest dataset at 10-m resolution, namely, Highresolution Global Mangrove Forests (HGMF\_2020), using object-based image analysis and random forest classification. We then analyzed the status of global mangrove forests from the perspectives of conservation, threats, and resistance to ocean disasters. We concluded the following: (1) globally, there were 145,068 km2 mangrove forests in 2020, among which Asia contained the largest coverage (39.2\%); at the country level, Indonesia had the largest amount of mangrove forests, followed by Brazil and Australia. (2) Mangrove forests in South Asia were estimated to be in the better status due to the higher proportion of conservation and larger individual patch size; in contrast, mangrove forests in East and Southeast Asia were facing intensive threats. (3) Nearly, 99\% of mangrove forest areas had a patch width greater than 100 m, suggesting that nearly all mangrove forests were efficient in reducing coastal wave energy and impacts. This study reports an innovative and up-to-date dataset and comprehensive information on mangrove forests status to contribute to related research and policy implementation, especially for supporting sustainable development.},

Marine aquaculture (mariculture) generates 37.5\% of this production and 97\% of the world's seaweed harvest. Mariculture products may offer a climate-friendly, high-protein food source, because they often have lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emission footprints than do the equivalent products farmed on land. However, sustainable intensification of low-emissions mariculture is key to maintaining a low GHG footprint as production scales up to meet future demand. We examine the major GHG sources and carbon sinks associated with fed finfish, macroalgae and bivalve mariculture, and the factors influencing variability across sectors. We highlight knowledge gaps and provide recommendations for GHG emissions reductions and carbon storage, including accounting for interactions between mariculture operations and surrounding marine ecosystems. By linking the provision of maricultured products to GHG abatement opportunities, we can advance climate-friendly practices that generate sustainable environmental, social, and economic outcomes.},

This study proposes a new orientation in SSF studies by exploring the assemblage of entangled sociomaterial processes that account for coastal transformations by investigating waterfront transformation in a fishing community in Karnataka, India. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork, we conclude that an entanglement of sociomaterial processes produces unequal outcomes among stakeholders that subsequently reinforce the political and economic marginalization of certain groups of waterfront users. Moreover, the investigated context-specific waterfront assemblage intimately connects to the broader context of national fishery policy, urbanization, and tourism, directing the way coastal space can and should be transformed. Such an analysis contributes to the understanding of changing livelihoods in SSF communities.},

The study contributes to the understanding of historical events that have discouraged the take-off and scale-up of community-based conservation approaches, such as locally-managed marine areas (LMMAs). LMMAs are being promoted increasingly as a desirable approach in marine conservation. However, there are a limited numbers of cases where such initiatives have been used as a strategy for marine management in sub-Saharan Africa, and very few operational examples of such schemes exist in the Western Indian Ocean region. Through semi-structured questionnaires, 193 community members selected randomly from 15 villages of the Mnazi Bay-Ruvuma Estuary Marine Park (MBREMP), Mtwara district, Southern Tanzania, were interviewed about their attitudes towards efforts to promote local management and the conservation of marine resources. The study also involved 17 focus group discussions, 13 in-depth key informant interviews, participant observation, and a review of secondary information. Over 85\% of the questionnaire respondents commented that there was insufficient participation by legitimate community representatives in the development of the MBREMP. Almost 90\% of the respondents agreed that the management of marine areas has increased significantly, particularly in the last two decades following initiatives by the government, donors and external NGOs. However, 70\% of the questionnaire responders had observed that a rapid shift from centralised to community-based management has been hindered by a lack of acceptable community rules and by communities frequently equating conservation with prohibition. Developing LMMAs in areas based on the lessons learned from MPAs could be a better alternative to developing entirely new communitymanaged areas; however, this can only succeed if limitations including the key principles of community participation and empowerment are addressed.},

A time-variant, stage-classified, matrix population model was developed to interpret the seasonal variation of octopus stage densities and to estimate several life cycle parameters. An annual and a semi-annual periodic cycle were found in the stage densities. A main peak of benthic settlement was observed during summer and a secondary, irregular one during late autumn. Two spawning peaks were estimated, a main one during late winter{\textendash}spring and a secondary one during late summer{\textendash}early autumn. More than 50\% of the just-settled individuals will eventually die after 3 months. Mortality rate declines, as individuals grow larger, reaches a minimum approximately 6 months after settlement, and then grows again probably because of terminal spawning. The life expectancy of recently settled individuals ({$<$}50 g) during their summer peak is approximately 5 months. The lifespan of the common octopus is estimated to be between 12 and 15 months.

The main objective is to study the effect of slow time scale delays on the convergence of the replicator dynamics to the Evolutionary Stable Strategy (ESS). In particular, we investigate the effect of time delays on the stability of the replicator dynamics. We can distinguish two types of the time delay: strategic delay which is the delay associated with the strategies of players, and spatial delay, which is the delay associated with the communities of the players. We prove that for large strategic delays, the mixed intermediate ESS may become an unstable state for the replicator dynamics, while for any value of the spatial delay, the replicator dynamics converge to the intermediate ESS. We also show that when both types of the time delay coexist, the instability property is emphasized.},

  abstract = {The artisanal fishery in south-west Madagascar, around the coastal cities of Morondava, Morombe and Tule{\textasciiacute}ar, is particularly active. In the Morombe and Tule{\textasciiacute}ar regions, fishing pressure focuses on coral formations close to landing sites and reef fish constitute the main part of the catch (Lethrinidae, Haemulidae, Siganidae). In Morondava, fishing is practised very close to the shore on sandy substrates, but also on offshore reef shallows. The catches are more diverse and made up of reef fish (Serranidae, Lutjanidae) and non-reef species. Fishing from Morondava targets the highest trophic level of the coral reefs (piscivores/ macroinvertebrate feeders: 87\% of the catch) whereas in Tule{\textasciiacute}ar and Morombe the higher fishing effort means that lower trophic levels are targeted to maintain catches. Despite the high fishing effort, especially around Morombe and Tule{\textasciiacute}ar (standardizing fishing effort of 5200 hook h km{\textendash}2 year{\textendash}1 and of 12 300 hook h km{\textendash}2 year{\textendash}1, respectively), the catch per unit effort (CPUE) is still relatively high; it varies from 0.6 to 2 kg h-1 per person over the whole zone and seems to be more linked to the fishing method used and to the degree of professionalism than to variations in the abundance of the resources surrounding the three cities. The relatively high CPUE can probably be explained by a continual immigration and/or recruitment on these fishing grounds. The fish originate from sectors that are far from towns and weakly exploited. A sociological study was carried out concurrently with the fishing survey and focused on present-day transformations within the fishing community.},

Such incorporation may also not necessarily lead to improved estimation or management performance. We demonstrate a way to incorporate such an index into an assessment model (Stock Synthesis), and use risk analysis to evaluate its management-related advantages and shortcomings. We applied this method to splitnose rockfish (Sebastes diploproa), where a previously developed growth index is highly correlated with decadal-scale climate indices. We find that including a similar index in the simulated assessment increases precision and reduces bias of parameter estimates. However, not including an index or including a completely erroneous index led to highly imprecise estimates when growth was strongly climate-driven. Including this growth index when individual growth was actually constant did not lead to poorer estimation performance. The risk analysis approach can be applied to other stocks to evaluate the consequences of including an index of growth variation.},

Sea cages are the dominant production system for the on-growing stage of salmon farming. It represents an effective production system with lower investment and running costs than land-based systems. The development and improvement of the sea cage farming system has been one of the most important factors for the growth of the salmon farming industry. However, during recent years certain problems related to their placement in the open marine environment have proved highly challenging, increasing operating costs and impacting on industry public relations. The problems are mainly due to parasites, diseases and escape of fish. In this article, emerging technical solutions for solving those problems are described.},

  abstract = {Since the Balearics are one of the key tourism destinations in Europe, the tourism industry has entailed a radical transformation of coastal life on the islands. In the 1960s and 1970s, fish captures increased enormously due to the expansion of consumption derived from tourism, and through technological improvements. There has been a change in target species from cheap fish consumed by local people towards expensive species consumed by tourists. However, since the 1980s a combination of factors including the adoption of the EU Common Fisheries Policy, the globalization of trade, and overfishing of some target species has led to a drastic fall in fishing sector jobs, catch reductions, and an increase in cheap imports. This article analyses the transformation of Balearic fisheries combining ecological economics (EE) and political ecology (PE) approaches. Material flow accounting (MFA) and the ecological footprint (EF) are applied in order to conceptualize the biophysical dimension of fisheries in relation to the historical dynamics of capital in the archipelago. Between 1940 and 2012, total fish catches doubled the official landings, while nonreported or hidden catches were underestimated. In the neoliberal period (1990-2012), fish catches decreased and seafood consumption was satisfied mainly through imports, five times the local captures. Thus, the metabolism of fish consumption in the Balearics illustrates the logics of capital and its metabolism in advanced capitalist regions, characterized by the displacement of socio-ecological conflicts to distant waters.},

  abstract = {Since 2004, the creation of locally managed marine areas (LMMAs) in Madagascar has exponentially increased, highlighting the need for improved information sharing between communities and between support organizations. Until recently, however, these LMMAs operated in relative isolation, with little communication or coordination between LMMA community associations. Madagascar's first national LMMA forum was held to address this need in June 2012 in the village of Andavadoaka, on Madagascar's southwest coast. The forum brought together 55 community members from 18 LMMAs throughout Madagascar, representing a total of 134 villages. A principle outcome of this meeting was the formation of a national LMMA network named MIHARI, a Malagasy acronym that translates into `local marine resource management'. The nascent MIHARI network is an informal network that was inspired by the success of the LMMA Network in the Indo{$\mkern1mu$}-{$\mkern1mu$}Pacific region. MIHARI aims to facilitate peer{$\mkern1mu$}-{$\mkern1mu$}to{$\mkern1mu$}-{$\mkern1mu$}peer learning amongst coastal communities, improve communication, raise the profile and expand the use of the LMMA approach and serve as a unified lobbying platform for the interests of Madagascar's traditional fishers. The creation of MIHARI represents a significant development towards uniting community{$\mkern1mu$}-{$\mkern1mu$}led approaches to conservation in Madagascar and highlights the significant role LMMAs can play in marine conservation on a national scale. This is of particular significance in Madagascar, a country with little capacity or financial resources to oversee large{$\mkern1mu$}-{$\mkern1mu$}scale marine conservation efforts, a problem compounded by both the vast coastline and geographical isolation of many fishing communities. Madagascar's new LMMA network is leading the way for coastal community conservation in the western Indian Ocean and aims to serve as the basis for a wider regional LMMA network.},

Few studies have objectively and simultaneously examined the types of MPAs that are most effective in conserving reef resources and the socioeconomic factors responsible for effective conservation [4{\textendash}6]. We simultaneously explored measures of reef and socioeconomic conservation success at four national parks, four comanaged reserves, and three traditionally managed areas in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. Underwater visual censuses of key ecological indicators [7, 8] revealed that the average size and biomass of fishes were higher in all areas under traditional management and at one comanaged reserve when compared to nearby unmanaged areas. Socioeconomic assessments [6, 9, 10] revealed that this ``effective conservation'' was positively related to compliance, visibility of the reserve, and length of time the management had been in place but negatively related to market integration, wealth, and village population size. We suggest that in cases where the resources for enforcement are lacking, management regimes that are designed to meet community goals can achieve greater compliance and subsequent conservation success than regimes designed primarily for biodiversity conservation.},

Herbivory was estimated by assay and biomass methods, and both methods indicated higher herbivory in Wshery closures. Despite higher herbivory, the eVect of the ENSO disturbance was larger within these closures, with reefs undergoing a temporary transition from dominance by hard and soft coral to a temporary dominance of turf and erect algae that ended in the dominance of calcifying algae, massive Porites, Pocillopora and a few faviids six years after the disturbance. The Wshed reefs changed the least but had a greater cover of turf and erect algae and sponge shortly after the disturbance. Higher herbivory in the Wshery closures reduced the abundance and persistence of herbivore-susceptible erect algae and created space and appropriate substratum for recruiting corals. Nonetheless, other post-settlement processes may have had strong inXuences such that annual rates of coral recovery were low ({\guillemotright}2\%) and not diVerent between the management regimes. Recovery, as deWned as and measured by the return to predisturbance coral cover and the dominant taxa, was slower in Wshery closures than unmanaged reefs.},

This principle{\textemdash}the homophily principle{\textemdash}structures network ties of every type, including marriage, friendship, work, advice, support, information transfer, exchange, comembership, and other types of relationship. The result is that people's personal networks are homogeneous with regard to many sociodemographic, behavioral, and intrapersonal characteristics. Homophily limits people's social worlds in a way that has powerful implications for the information they receive, the attitudes they form, and the interactions they experience. Homophily in race and ethnicity creates the strongest divides in our personal environments, with age, religion, education, occupation, and gender following in roughly that order. Geographic propinquity, families, organizations, and isomorphic positions in social systems all create contexts in which homophilous relations form. Ties between nonsimilar individuals also dissolve at a higher rate, which sets the stage for the formation of niches (localized positions) within social space. We argue for more research on: (a) the basic ecological processes that link organizations, associations, cultural communities, social movements, and many other social forms; (b) the impact of multiplex ties on the patterns of homophily; and (c) the dynamics of network change over time through which networks and other social entities co-evolve.},

  abstract = {Mangroves are defined by the presence of trees that mainly occur in the intertidal zone, between land and sea, in the (sub) tropics. The intertidal zone is characterised by highly variable environmental factors, such as temperature, sedimentation and tidal currents. The aerial roots of mangroves partly stabilise this environment and provide a substratum on which many species of plants and animals live. Above the water, the mangrove trees and canopy provide important habitat for a wide range of species. These include birds, insects, mammals and reptiles. Below the water, the mangrove roots are overgrown by epibionts such as tunicates, sponges, algae, and bivalves. The soft substratum in the mangroves forms habitat for various infaunal and epifaunal species, while the space between roots provides shelter and food for motile fauna such as prawns, crabs and fishes. Mangrove litter is transformed into detritus, which partly supports the mangrove food web. Plankton, epiphytic algae and microphytobenthos also form an important basis for the mangrove food web. Due to the high abundance of food and shelter, and low predation pressure, mangroves form an ideal habitat for a variety of animal species, during part or all of their life cycles. As such, mangroves may function as nursery habitats for (commercially important) crab, prawn and fish species, and support offshore fish populations and fisheries. Evidence for linkages between mangroves and offshore habitats by animal migrations is still scarce, but highly needed for management and conservation purposes. Here, we firstly reviewed the habitat function of mangroves by common taxa of terrestrial and marine animals. Secondly, we reviewed the literature with regard to the degree of interlinkage between mangroves and adjacent habitats, a research area which has received increasing attention in the last decade. Finally, we reviewed current insights into the degree to which mangrove litter fuels the mangrove food web, since this has been the subject of longstanding debate.},

The multi-scaled and evolutionary nature of sustainable development issues requires that community groups dedicated to engaging with such issues be particularly diverse, resilient, and flexible.

  abstract = {Marine reserves have come under criticism because of the short-term fishery losses likely to be associated with them. At the same time, marine reserves have been touted as a tool to rehabilitate depleted populations, at least for species with relatively limited adult movement. I used models to compare the short- and long-term fisheries consequences of three fishery-management tools for depleted populations. These management tools included temporary closure of the entire fishery, minimum size limits, and marine reserves. I compared them using three short-term indices: magnitude of initial drop in catches relative to those prior to new management, years until catches reached prior levels, and cumulative loss during those years. I examined a single long-term index: long-term sustainable yields. Results highlighted the potential of reserves as an efficient and effective fishery-management tool for species that will remain within reserve boundaries. Reserves created few short-term losses beyond those associated with other management measures, yet produced the highest stable catch levels. Moreover, peak catches with reserves occurred with less restriction than peak catches with other management measures. These results were consistent across two species that matured before entering the fishery but did not apply to one species that was fished while immature. In that latter case, minimum size limits produced more substantial benefits than reserves could. Nevertheless, these analyses suggest that a wide range of circumstances exist where reserves, if properly designed to minimize adult spillover while allowing abundant larval transport, can maximize fisheries harvests with a minimum of total restrictions.},

  abstract = {The dynamic nature of most environments forces many animals to move to meet their fundamental needs. This is especially true in aquatic environments where shifts in spatial ecology (which are a result of movements) are among the first adaptive responses of animals to changes in ecosystems. Changes in the movement and distribution of individuals will in turn alter population dynamics and ecosystem structure. Thus, understanding the drivers and impacts of variation in animal movements over time is critical to conservation and spatial planning. Here, we identify key challenges that impede aquatic animal movement science from informing management and conservation, and propose strategies for overcoming them. Challenges include: (1) Insufficient communication between terrestrial and aquatic movement scientists that could be increased through cross-pollination of analytical tools and development of new tools and outputs; (2) Incomplete coverage in many studies of animal space use (e.g., entire life span not considered); (3) Insufficient data archiving and availability; (4) Barriers to incorporating movement data into decision-making processes; and (5) Limited understanding of the value of movement data for management and conservation. We argue that the field of movement ecology is at present an under-tapped resource for aquatic decision-makers, but is poised to play a critical role in future management approaches and policy development.},

Growing global demand for seafood has attracted diverse actors to African waters, including Distant Water Fishing Nations (DWFNs) fleets. Complex fisheries governance challenges, unsustainable rates of fishing and rising fisheries-related crimes have ensued. To reverse these impacts, some African states are deploying various fisheries governance mechanisms. Drawing on extensive expert experiences, the review of literature, fisheries databases, international and regional agency reports, NGO and government reports and case studies from West and East Africa, we demonstrate two critical findings. First, fisheries governance mechanisms in Africa act largely to constrain small-scale fisheries (SSF) while failing to contain the industrial fisheries sector, resulting in the marginalisation of the SSF. Secondly, despite a higher incidence of Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in industrial fisheries than the SSF, fisheries governance mechanisms continue to advance the 'Survival of the Richest' {\textendash} the industrial sector, to the detriment of the 'Fittest' {\textendash} the SSF. The SSF supports millions of jobs and is better adapted to meet the continents' nutrition and socio-economic security. For the fisheries sector to contribute to the sustainable development of Africans, states must redirect governance towards regulating the industrial sector, emphasising equitable access for the SSF whilst prioritising ecological sustainability.},

  abstract = {Mathematical models that couple disease dynamics and vaccinating behaviour often assume that the incentive to vaccinate disappears if disease prevalence is zero. Hence, they predict that vaccine refusal should be the rule, and elimination should be difficult or impossible. In reality, countries with non-mandatory vaccination policies have usually been able to maintain elimination or very low incidence of paediatric infectious diseases for long periods of time. Here, we show that including injunctive social norms can reconcile such behaviour-incidence models to observations. Adding social norms to a coupled behaviour-incidence model enables the model to better explain pertussis vaccine uptake and disease dynamics in the UK from 1967 to 2010, in both the vaccine-scare years and the years of high vaccine coverage. The model also illustrates how a vaccine scare can perpetuate suboptimal vaccine coverage long after perceived risk has returned to baseline, pre-vaccine-scare levels. However, at other model parameter values, social norms can perpetuate depressed vaccine coverage during a vaccine scare well beyond the time when the population's baseline vaccine risk perception returns to pre-scare levels. Social norms can strongly suppress vaccine uptake despite frequent outbreaks, as observed in some small communities. Significant portions of the parameter space also exhibit bistability, meaning long-term outcomes depend on the initial conditions. Depending on the context, social norms can either support or hinder immunization goals.},

  abstract = {Sudden changes in populations are ubiquitous in ecological systems, especially under perturbations. The agents of global change may increase the frequency and severity of anthropogenic perturbations, but complex populations' responses hamper our understanding of their dynamics and resilience. Furthermore, the long-term environmental and demographic data required to study those sudden changes are rare. Fitting dynamical models with an artificial intelligence algorithm to population fluctuations over 40 y in a social bird reveals that feedback in dispersal after a cumulative perturbation drives a population collapse. The collapse is well described by a nonlinear function mimicking social copying, whereby dispersal made by a few individuals induces others to leave the patch in a behavioral cascade for decision-making to disperse. Once a threshold for deterioration of the quality of the patch is crossed, there is a tipping point for a social response of runaway dispersal corresponding to social copying feedback. Finally, dispersal decreases at low population densities, which is likely due to the unwillingness of the more philopatric individuals to disperse. In providing the evidence of copying for the emergence of feedback in dispersal in a social organism, our results suggest a broader impact of self-organized collective dispersal in complex population dynamics. This has implications for the theoretical study of population and metapopulation nonlinear dynamics, including population extinction, and managing of endangered and harvested populations of social animals subjected to behavioral feedback loops.},

It also contributes wholly or partly to the income and subsistence of thousands of families around the world. Despite its broad ecological, social, and economic importance, limited research has been conducted to describe the scope and scale of the global cephalopod trade. To date, there is no specific regulation, nor have tracking systems been implemented, to study the traceability of the global cephalopod trade at an international level. We provide, for the first time, a comprehensive description of the legal trade in cephalopods to understand who the key world players in the cephalopod seafood markets are. We analysed 20 years of records compiled by the United Nations COMTRADE database. The database contained 115,108 entries for squid and cuttlefish and 71,659 entries for octopus, including the product flow between traders (countries or territories) weighted by volume (kg) and monetary value (USD). Graph theoretic analysis was used to explore the emergent properties of this database through the analysis of different measures of centrality that provide insights on the key role of the traders in the network. Our findings show that most of the market movements between ca. 250 traders are led by three countries (China, Spain, and Japan), involving 11 clusters of traders based on the volume and value of cephalopod trade and number of transactions. The most important cluster, that dominates the cephalopod seafood market, is composed by 5 Asian countries (China, India, Republic of Korea, Thailand, and Vietnam), 2 European countries (the Netherlands and Spain) and the USA. This work identifies the traders that act as major exporters and/or importers, the modulators, intermediaries or accumulators, the best-connected traders, the principal flow routes and the weaknesses of the global cephalopod trade network. This network information is essential to advance towards a transparent and sustainable cephalopods world trade.},

By examining fisheries in the northeastern United States over the last four decades of warming temperatures, we show that northward shifts in species distributions were matched by corresponding northward shifts in fisheries. The proportion of warm-water species caught in most states also increased through time. Most importantly, however, fisheries shifted only 10{\textendash}30 \% as much as their target species, and evidence suggested that economic and regulatory constraints played important roles in creating these lags. These lags may lead to overfishing and population declines if not accounted for in fisheries management and climate adaptation. In coupled natural-human systems such as fisheries, human actions play important roles in determining the sustainability of the system and, therefore, future conservation and climate mitigation planning will need to consider not only biophysical changes, but also human responses to these changes and the feedbacks that these responses have on ecosystems.},

Surveys of terrestrial species have suggested that large-bodied species and top predators are the most at risk, and it is commonly assumed that such patterns also apply in the ocean. However, there has been no global test of this hypothesis in the sea. We analyzed two fisheries datasets (stock assessments and landings) to determine the life-history traits of species that have suffered dramatic population collapses. Contrary to expectations, our data suggest that up to twice as many fisheries for small, low trophic-level species have collapsed compared with those for large predators. These patterns contrast with those on land, suggesting fundamental differences in the ways that industrial fisheries and land conversion affect natural communities. Even temporary collapses of small, low trophic-level fishes can have ecosystem-wide impacts by reducing food supply to larger fish, seabirds, and marine mammals.},

This is particularly true for the Greater Virunga Landscape, which includes Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and ten contiguous protected areas in Uganda and Rwanda. The larger bodied animal species that occur in this landscape have moved freely across what are now international borders for millennia and some species probably need this larger landscape if their populations are to remain viable. An analysis was carried out to identify these `landscape species' and the importance of this cross-border movement is assessed in the light of civil wars in the region. For 13 years the International Gorilla Conservation Programme has been working in the Virunga Volcanoes and Bwindi Impenetrable National Park to foster transboundary collaboration. The results have shown that regular meetings and planning of activities by wardens can lead to better conservation even with countries at war with each other. More recently the Wildlife Conservation Society has started a programme to support transboundary collaboration further north in the landscape so that all contiguous protected areas are working together. The results show that mountain gorilla numbers have on the whole increased during the past 25 years despite civil wars in the region and this can largely be attributed to their ability to generate income from tourism but also to enhanced transboundary collaboration between Congo, Rwanda and Uganda. Ungulate numbers on the other hand have declined drastically since the 1960s but it is shown that the connectivity in the landscape has been important in reducing the impact of the civil war on elephants.},

  abstract = {As a result of declining and overfished small-scale nearshore fisheries in Southeast Asia, there are increasing conflicts and social tensions between and among different user groups, leading to coastal ``fish wars''. A challenge facing fishers, resource managers and national decision makers in the region is to identify more appropriate governance and public policy mechanisms to manage conflicts over fishery resources and to resolve them productively in the interests of both long-term sustainability and short-term economic feasibility. A quantitative analysis undertaken in selected coastal communities in Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam with and without co-management indicate that co-management does lead to reduced resource conflict levels. The analysis has also shown that when resource conflicts are reduced, food security improves.},

The United States of America (USA) and Mexico share a number of fish stocks and marine ecosystems, while there is some binational co-\-operation in scientific research, unilateral management decisions are generally the rule. We present a case study using the giant sea bass (Stereolepis gigas, Polyprionidae) to highlight how these management and research asymmetries can skew national perceptions of population status for a fully transboundary species. Scientific publications and annual funding related to giant sea bass are 7x and 25x higher in the USA, respectively, despite the fact that 73\% of the species' range occurs in Mexico. Conversely, annual fishery production and consumptive value of giant sea bass in Mexico are 19x and 3.5x higher than in the USA, respectively, while the non-\- consumptive value related to dive ecotourism is 76x higher in the USA. These asymmetries have generated a distorted view of the population status of the giant sea bass across its entire range. This and other factors related to historical fishery dynamics and policy must be accounted for when assessing population status, and subsequent appropriate management responses, across geopolitical boundaries.},

Yet, because tropical fisheries are often data-poor, mechanisms that might buffer fishers to declines are not understood. This data scarcity undermines fisheries management, making tropical fishing livelihoods particularly vulnerable to changes in marine resources. We use high-resolution fisheries data from Seychelles to understand how fishing strategy (catch diversification) influences catch rates and revenues of individual fishing vessels. We show that average catch weight decreased by 65\% over 27 years, with declines in all nine species groups coinciding with increases in fishing effort. However, for individual vessels, catch diversity was associated with larger catches and higher fishing revenues and with slower catch declines from 1990 to 2016. Management strategies should maximize catch diversity in data-poor tropical fisheries to help secure nutritional security while protecting fishing livelihoods.},

  abstract = {Cephalopods are voracious, versatile predators. They generally have a short life span and a single spawning event followed by death. Populations are subject to dramatic fluctuations and their impact on prey populations is equally variable. The prehensile arms and tentacles of cephalopods, coupled with a highly evolved sensory system, allow them to occupy a broad trophic niche and migrations enable populations to exploit the temporal and spatial variability of production systems and populations of prey. Shoaling is a common behavioural feature of many species which facilitates prey capture and contributes to the impact of cephalopods on prey populations. Research on cephalopod stomach contents is hampered because the beak is used to bite the prey into small pieces so hard parts, which are usually needed for identification of prey species, are often rejected causing potential bias in estimation of diet. Cephalopods may also feed unnaturally in the presence of sampling gear. Despite these problems there is a growing body of data on cephalopod predation collected using direct observations, conventional visual analysis of stomach contents and serological methods. Most species feed on small crustaceans as juveniles and shift the diet to larger fish and other cephalopods during growth. This shift is accompanied by ontogenetic changes in the allometry of the brachial crown. There is increasing evidence that myctophid fishes are an important food resource for oceanic squid. The diet and stock size of some commercially exploited squid populations is sufficiently well known to quantify the impact of a single generation on the prey community. Where there is predation on commercial stocks of fish and crustaceans, the effect of cephalopod feeding on recruitment may be significant. Cephalopods are trophic opportunists in marine food webs from polar to equatorial seas.},

A series of natural fishing experiments over this period involving marine reserves were monitored at each island, where estimates of fishing intensity and selectivity were available. Fishing intensity (15\% and 25\% of biomass removed per year at Sumilon and Apo, respectively) was high enough to affect total community biomass, but not density, significantly. Species richness was not affected significantly by fishing, except at Sumilon reserve. The fishery was relatively non-selective with most families/trophic groups caught roughly in proportion to their contribution to community biomass. Thus fishing did not alter the relative abundance of the major families/trophic groups significantly, except during a period of use of explosives and drive nets in the Sumilon reserve. At the level of family/trophic group the community displayed strong resilience of structure. There was little evidence of secondary effects e.g. declines in abundance of large predators resulting in measurable increases in abundance of their prey. This resilience of the community to the effects of fishing most likely results from three important community attributes (open nature of the component populations, likely maintenance of upstream recruitment supply and apparent lack of any obvious ``keystone'' species or families) and one important characteristic of the fishery (relatively non-selective with respect to the components of the community).},

  abstract = {In Indonesia, small-scale fisheries involve about 90\% of the total number of fishers and generate significant employment for coastal communities. As defined by Indonesian law, these fisheries are exempted from catch reporting which creates a large gap in catch data for estimating stock status and fishing pressure. Indonesian small-scale fishers are scattered across thousands of islands so that monitoring catches is difficult without a systematic approach to ensure long-term benefits. This paper describes the results of work by the Indonesian Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries, in partnership with the USAID Sustainable Ecosystems Advanced (SEA) Project, to initiate the development of a fishing logbook system for small-scale fisheries. This initiative addressed challenging issues pertaining to Indonesian institutional arrangements, capabilities of small-scale fisheries and reliability of fishing logbook data. A holistic intervention using the sustainable livelihood approach was used to unpack the complexities and develop strategies of enabling factors to establish a catch monitoring system for Indonesian small-scale fisheries. This initiative shows that a tradeoff between an ideal fishing logbook system versus an applicable model that may compromise logbook data qualities is inevitable. Also, co-management is seen as a suitable for the purposes of establishing a catch reporting system for Indonesian small-scale fisheries. The initial work described herein is seen as an essential steppingstone for improving management of small-scale fisheries in Indonesia.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we review observations, theory and model results on the monsoon circulation of the Indian Ocean. We begin with a general overview, discussing wind-stress forcing fields and their anomalies, climatological distributions of stratification, mixed-layer depths, altimetric sea-level distributions, and seasonal circulation patterns (Section 2). The three main monsoon circulation sections deal with the equatorial regime (Section 3), the Somali Current and western Arabian Sea (Section 4), and the Bay of Bengal, seasonally reversing monsoon currents south of India and Sri Lanka, and the eastern and central Arabian Sea (Section 5). For the equatorial regime, we discuss equatorial jets and undercurrents, their interactions with the eastern and western boundaries, and intraseasonal and vertically propagating signals. In the Somali Current section, we describe the ocean's responses to the summer and winter monsoon winds, and outline the modelling efforts that have been carried out to understand them. In the Bay of Bengal section, we present observational and modeling evidence showing the importance of remote forcing from the east, which to a large extent originates along the equator. In the following three sections, we review the southern-hemisphere subtropical regime and its associated boundary currents (Section 6), the Indonesian Throughflow (Section 7), the Red Sea and Persian Gulf circulations (Section 8), and discuss aspects of their interactions with other Indian-Ocean circulations. Next, we describe the Indian Ocean's deep and shallow meridional overturning cells (Section 9). Model results show large seasonal variability of the meridional overturning streamfunction and heat flux, and we discuss possible physical mechanisms behind this variability. While the monsoon-driven variability of the deep cell is mostly a sloshing motion affecting heat storage, interesting water-mass transformations and monsoonal reversals occur in the shallow crossequatorial cell. In the mean, the shallow cell connects the subduction areas in the southern subtropics and parts of the Indonesian Throughflow waters with the upwelling areas of the northern hemisphere via the cross-equatorial Somali Current. Its near-surface branch includes a shallow equatorial roll that is seasonally reversing. We close by looking at coupled ocean-climate anomalies, in particular the large events that were observed in the tropical and subtropical Indian Ocean in 1993/94 and 1997/98. These events have been interpreted as an independent Indian-Ocean climate mode by some investigators and as an ENSO-forced anomaly by others.  2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Large rivers often bisect geopolitical boundaries where management goals may be at odds for a shared fishery, creating fragmented management zones. Fragmentation due to physical barriers may further impact the fishery by reducing fish passage. Our goal was to estimate basinwide parameters (i.e. movement, survival and capture probabilities) of a large-river species known to move throughout watersheds. We tagged13 892 Channel Catfish in the Red River of the North (Red River) and Lake Winnipeg in Manitoba, Canada, and collected 553 recaptures. We estimated 2.2\% of catfish are moving from the Red River to Lake Winnipeg each month and 9.4\%, primarily large ({$>$}600 mm) individuals, moved upstream through a dam (monthly). Approximately 5.6\% of catfish moved to the USA each month, and only one fish returned. Our results suggest the lower reaches of the Red River may be a source population for the USA, where survival is lower, and Lake Winnipeg. The complex movements of Channel Catfish throughout the Red River, across barriers and international boundaries, suggest conservation and management of fish populations should be watershed wide.

  abstract = {Human systems and environmental systems are often treated as existing in isolation from one another, whereas in fact they are often two parts of a single, coupled human-environment system. Developing theoretical models of coupled human-environment systems is a continuing area of research, although relatively few of these models are based on differential equations. Here we develop a simple differential equation coupled human-environment system model of coupled forest growth dynamics and conservationist opinion dynamics in a human population. The model assumes logistic growth and harvesting in the forest. Opinion spread in the human population is based the interplay between conservation values stimulated by forest rarity, and injunctive social norms that tend to support population conformity. We find that injunctive social norms drive the system to the boundaries of phase space, whereas rarity-based conservation priorities drive the system to the interior. The result is complex dynamics including limit cycles and alternative stable states that do not occur if injunctive social norms are absent. We also find that increasing the inherent perceived value of forests is the best way to boost and stabilize forest cover while also boosting conservationist opinion in the population. We conclude that simple models can provide insights and suggest patterns that might be harder to see with complicated, high-dimensional models, and therefore should be pursued more often in research on coupled human-environment systems.},

With projected rapid continual growth in the sector, if left unmanaged, aquaculture pollution can have detrimental environmental and social implications. Using the DPSIR framework, the paper examines current practices and pathways of plastic pollution from marine aquaculture in the NE-Atlantic, drawing on findings from literature, stakeholder consultations and beach litter assessments. Pathways for aquaculture-related litter identified include rough weather, farmer behavior, inadequate access to recycling facilities, low price of consumable plastics and high cost of recycling. Beach litter analyses conducted as part of the study exposed serious issues of under quantification, resulting from difficulties in source identification and a lack of detailed categorization in official monitoring systems. The paper makes recommendations to improve litter quantification and waste management, including the use of local knowledge and experts to identify sources of marine litter.},

For instance, over-fishing of parrotfish {\textendash} an important grazer of macroalgae that can prevent destructive overgrowth of macroalgae {\textendash} has threatened reef ecosystems in recent decades and stimulated conservation efforts such as the formation of marine protected areas. Here we develop a mathematical model of coupled socio-ecological interactions between reef dynamics and conservation opinion dynamics to better understand how natural and human factors interact individually and in combination to determine coral reef cover. We find that the coupling opinion and reef systems generates complex dynamics that are difficult to anticipate without use of a model. For instance, instead of converging to a stable state of constant coral cover and conservationist opinion, the system can oscillate between low and high live coral cover as human opinion oscillates in a boom-bust cycle between complacency and concern. Out of various possible parameter manipulations, we also find that raising awareness of coral reef endangerment best avoids counter-productive nonlinear feedbacks and always increases and stabilizes live coral reef cover. In conclusion, an improved understanding of coupled opinion-reef dynamics under anthrogenic stressors is possible using coupled socio-ecological models, and such models should be further researched.},

  abstract = {World food prices hit an all-time high in February 2011 and are still almost two and a half times those of 2000. Although three billion people worldwide use seafood as a key source of animal protein, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations{\textendash}which compiles prices for other major food categories{\textendash}has not tracked seafood prices. We fill this gap by developing an index of global seafood prices that can help to understand food crises and may assist in averting them. The fish price index (FPI) relies on trade statistics because seafood is heavily traded internationally, exposing non-traded seafood to price competition from imports and exports. Easily updated trade data can thus proxy for domestic seafood prices that are difficult to observe in many regions and costly to update with global coverage. Calculations of the extent of price competition in different countries support the plausibility of reliance on trade data. Overall, the FPI shows less volatility and fewer price spikes than other food price indices including oils, cereals, and dairy. The FPI generally reflects seafood scarcity, but it can also be separated into indices by production technology, fish species, or region. Splitting FPI into capture fisheries and aquaculture suggests increased scarcity of capture fishery resources in recent years, but also growth in aquaculture that is keeping pace with demand. Regionally, seafood price volatility varies, and some prices are negatively correlated. These patterns hint that regional supply shocks are consequential for seafood prices in spite of the high degree of seafood tradability.},

While assessments of flood risk mitigation by coastal ecosystems are mainly restricted to local scales, our study assesses the contribution of salt marshes and mangroves to nature-based storm surge mitigation in 11 large deltas around the world. We present a relatively simple GIS model that, based on globally available input data, provides an estimation of the tidal wetland's capacity of risk mitigation at a regional scale. It shows the high potential of nature-based solutions, as tidal wetlands, to provide storm surge mitigation to more than 80\% of the flood-exposed land area for 4 of the 11 deltas and to more than 70\% of the flood-exposed population for 3 deltas. The magnitude of the nature-based mitigation, estimated as the length of the storm surge pathway crossing through tidal wetlands, was found to be significantly correlated to the total wetland area within a delta. This highlights the importance of conserving extensive continuous tidal wetlands as a nature-based approach to mitigate flood risks. Our analysis further reveals that deltas with limited historical wetland reclamation and therefore large remaining wetlands, such as the Mississippi, the Niger, and part of the Ganges-Brahmaputra deltas, benefit from investing in the conservation of their vast wetlands, while deltas with extensive historical wetland reclamation, such as the Yangtze and Rhine deltas, may improve the sustainability of flood protection programs by combining existing hard engineering with new nature-based solutions through restoration of former wetlands.},

The present study investigated (1) diversity of Octopodidae in the Western Indian Ocean (WIO) and (2) connectivity and genetic structure of Octopus cyanea and O. vulgaris populations in order to obtain baseline data for management plans. A fragment of the cytochrome C oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene was sequenced in 275 octopus individuals from Madagascar, Kenya and Tanzania. In addition, 41 sequences of O. vulgaris from South Africa, Brazil, Amsterdam Island, Tristan da Cunha, Senegal and Galicia were retrieved from databases and included in this study. Five different species were identified using DNA barcoding, with first records for O. oliveri and Callistoctopus luteus in the WIO. For O. cyanea (n = 229, 563 bp), 22 haplotypes were found, forming one haplogroup. AMOVA revealed shallow but significant genetic population structure among all sites ({$\phi$}ST = 0.025, p = 0.02), with significant differentiation among: (1) Kanamai, (2) southern Kenya, Tanzania, North and West Madagascar, (3) Southwest Madagascar and (4) East Madagascar ({$\phi$}CT = 0.035, p = 0.017). For O. vulgaris (n = 71, 482 bp), 15 haplotypes were identified, forming three haplogroups. A significant genetic population structure was found among all sites ({$\phi$}ST = 0.82, p {\dbend} 0.01). Based on pairwise {$\phi$}ST-values and hierarchical AMOVAs, populations of O. vulgaris could be grouped as follows: (1) Brazil, (2) Madagascar and (3) all other sites. A significant increase in genetic distance with increasing geographic distance was found (Z = 232443, 81 r = 0.36, p = 0.039). These results indicate that for O. cyanea four regions should be considered as separate management units in the WIO. The very divergent haplogroups in O. vulgaris from Brazil and Madagascar might be evolving towards speciation and therefore should be considered as separate species in FAO statistics.},

Gut content analysis of the selected fish groups has shown significant variations in the prey composition and predator preference on a prey item. The diet matrix revealed Acetes sp. (32.74\%) as a key and common shared prey item, followed by mesopelagic fishes (30.51\%), other shrimps (11.00\%), digested material (7.42\%), crabs (4.03\%) and cephalopods (2.77\%), etc. In this study, Acetes sp was considered as a proxy for the non-penaeid prawns due to its significant contribution (92\%) to the total non-penaeid landings. Targeted exploitation of Acetes sp. has intensified recently (from 0.44 lakh t in 2004 to 1.40 lakh t in 2018) with an average annual growth rate of 11.2\% due to the demand from fish meal plants. By considering its ecological and fishery importance, Acetes sp. should be considered as keystone species in the ecosystem. The Schaefer surplus production model was used to calculate the Biological Reference Points (BRPs) and model parameters MSY, FMSY, r, EMSY, and K. The model fit was fair (R2 = 0.630) and significantly positive correlation was observed between CPUEobserved and CPUEmodel. The estimated optimum exploitation limits (p {$<$} 0.05) for the fishery were Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) as 1.20 lakh t and fishing effort required to harvest MSY (EMSY) as 51.30 lakh fishing hours. However, the recent exploitation yield and fishing effort are beyond the optimum exploitation limits. Further increase in exploitation of the resources may hamper the sustainability of the stocks and may lead to detrimental impact on the trophic interactions of the fishery resources. Technical interventions are needed in the field of post-harvest and value addition for attaining fair economic returns from the harvest which at present forms a low-value high-volume fishery. Sustainable exploitation and management measures need to be introduced and implemented for the Acetes sp. in order to sustain the stocks and to maintain the integrity of the fishery ecosystem.},

Many SSF are however under pressure, and in need of better management paying special attention to the key seascape ecosystems which are supporting them. This study investigates the importance of seagrass beds for SSF households and their food security in southwestern Madagascar. The specific aims of this study were to: i) analyze if and how seagrassassociated fish contributes to subsistence and/or the economy of local fishing households, ii) identify and compare seagrass ecosystem goods and services valued by local fishers in a rural and an urban setting, and iii) analyze links between local people and seagrasses in terms of local ecological knowledge, use and traditions. The results showed that seagrasses were the most important fishing habitats for most fishers. Seagrass-associated fish species were both the economically most important and most commonly fished species, and are a major source of protein in the region. Further, seagrass-derived sea urchins are important complements to local people's diets. The findings illustrate that seagrasses contribute both through subsistence and income generation to food se\- curity and wellbeing of coastal people in southwestern Madagascar. This highlights the need to consider seagrass ecosystems in management towards sustainable SSF and their ability to sustain food security for future generations.},

We found a total of 51 reports of documented changes in Arctic marine biota in response to climate change. Among the responses evaluated were range shifts and changes in abundance, growth/condition, behaviour/phenology and community/regime shifts. Most reports concerned marine mammals, particularly polar bears, and fish. The number of well-documented changes in planktonic and benthic systems was surprisingly low. Evident losses of endemic species in the Arctic Ocean, and in ice algae production and associated community remained difficult to evaluate due to the lack of quantitative reports of its abundance and distribution. Very few footprints of climate change were reported in the literature from regions such as the wide Siberian shelf and the central Arctic Ocean due to the limited research effort made in these ecosystems. Despite the alarming nature of warming and its strong potential effects in the Arctic Ocean the research effort evaluating the impacts of climate change in this region is rather limited.},

Women regionally account for well over half of octopus fishers, and are influenced by efforts to manage the resource. We assessed the role of gender in this fisheries management initiative, comparing fisheries landings for men and women over a seven-year period, and assessing female involvement in the management process through a series of focus groups and workshop discussions. Our findings showed that, while both genders benefit from the fisheries management initiative, men tend to harvest bigger octopus and dominate reserve management discourse and decision-making. We discuss these findings in relation to other natural resource management initiatives and recommend strategies to ensure better integration of women in octopus fishery management.},

  abstract = {As industrial vessels continue to expand in both extractive capacity and spatial range, concerns have grown over foreign industrial fishing occurring within the marine territories of developing countries, both legally and ille\- gally. Madagascar's status as a ``least developed country'', coupled with its high marine biodiversity, makes its waters particularly susceptible to fishing by distant water fishing nations (DWFNs). However, given constraints in management and research, it is unclear how foreign industrial fishing, both legal via foreign agreements and illegal, may impact local marine resources that many coastal communities depend on for food security, cultural meaning and livelihoods. We used satellite-derived fishing effort data from 2012 to 2020, via Global Fishing Watch, to analyze industrial fishing effort occurring within Madagascar's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). We documented 907,643 h of industrial fishing within the Madagascar EEZ across 277 vessels from 17 different countries. We found that Taiwanease vessels (39.8\%) using drifting longlines and Malagasy (17.2\% shrimp trawlers were the most prevalent. Fishing effort was highly seasonal (68\% of effort between October and February) and increased with higher global fish prices and the Indian Ocean Dipole, which is a measure of regional water temperature cycles. We also found a number of instances (17.6\% of the fishing effort for 170,726 total hours) of foreign fishing vessels operating close to shore and within a number of marine protected areas. These results highlight the need for increased transparency surrounding foreign fishing agreements and unau\- thorized fishing within the waters of developing countries. Increases in industrial fishing effort and encroach\- ment into near-shore areas has the potential to severely threaten current sustainable fisheries management initiatives by conservation organizations and coastal communities.},

  abstract = {Rare, but potentially impactful, extreme events in socio-ecological systems (SES) can trigger significant consequences. The scarcity of theoretical frameworks for such events in SES is due to data limitations and difficulty in building coupled SES models. We explore the effect of extreme events on coupled socio-ecological systems using two stylized case studies: harvesting of old-growth forests and coral reef fisheries. We found that extreme events alter the long-term and transient dynamics of the systems. We identify counter-intuitive situations where the degradation of forests or coral habitat can prevent extinction through social dynamics feedback. Management outcomes show maximum variability at intermediate disturbance frequencies, complicating predictions of ecological recovery. We also found that initial conditions significantly influence system responses to shocks. Lastly, we found that shocks to the ecological subsystem had far greater consequences than those that occurred in on the social side. Our work lays a foundation for future studies on extreme events in socio-ecological dynamics, highlighting the complexities of predicting coupled system responses to shocks.},

  abstract = {Seasonality is an important feature of essentially all natural systems but the consequences of seasonality have been vastly underappreciated. Early work emphasized the role of seasonality in driving cyclic population dynamics, but the consequences of seasonality for ecological processes are far broader. Yet, seasonality is often not explicitly included in either empirical or theoretical studies. Many aspects of ecological dynamics can only be understood when seasonality is included, ranging from the oscillations in the incidence of childhood diseases to the coexistence of species. Through several case studies, we outline what is now known about seasonality in an ecological context and set the stage for future efforts. We discuss various approaches and tools for incorporating seasonality in mathematical models. We argue, however, that these tools are still limited in scope and more easily-accessible approaches need to be developed.},

  abstract = {This study examines the impacts of ecosystem degradation on social welfare, focusing on the mangrove{\textendash}fishery linkage in Indonesia. Using nationally representative household data combined with satellite information on spatiotemporal mangrove loss, the study finds that fishery households experienced a decline in annual income ranging from 5.3\% to 9.8\% in response to a 1\% increase in mangrove loss in the region. Under the income shock, fishery households increased their labor input and decreased their non-food consumption; however, they continued being part of the fishery industry. Furthermore, according to a back-ofthe-envelope calculation, the potential economic value of mangrove conservation, estimated in terms of fishery production reached 22,861 US\$/hectare/year. This makes conservation substantially more cost-effective than alternative land uses, such as aquaculture and oil palm plantations. These findings highlight the need to support mangrove forest conservation to achieve sustainable development and ecosystem conservation.},

  abstract = {The Mozambique Channel region in East Africa has diverse marine ecosystems and serves as a migratory corridor for economically important species. Local and foreign industrial fisheries operate in the Mozambique Channel, but regional small-scale fisheries are the crucially important fisheries that provide food security, livelihoods, and economic opportunities for rural coastal communities. This study reconstructed and investigated trends in the fishing effort and catch per unit effort (CPUE) of small-scale marine fisheries in four Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) that constitute the Mozambique Channel, i.e., Union of Comoros, Madagascar, Mayotte, and Mozambique, from 1950 to 2016. Effective fishing effort for small-scale fisheries in the form of fishing capacity in kWdays (i.e., kilowatt days) was derived using the number, length, motorization (engine power) by fishing vessels, as well as an approximate human-powered equivalent for shore-based fishers without vessels, as well as days of fishing per year. Effective small-scale fishing effort in the Mozambique Channel increased by nearly 60 times from just over 386,000 kWdays in 1950 to over 23 million kWdays in 2016. Correspondingly, the overall small-scale CPUE, based on previously and independently reconstructed catch data declined by 91\% in the region as a whole, from just under 175 kg{$\cdot$}kWday               {\textendash}1               in the early 1950s to just over 15 kg{$\cdot$}kWday               {\textendash}1               in recent years. All four EEZs showed the strongest declines in the small-scale CPUE in the earlier decades, driven by motorization and growth in vessel numbers impacting effective fishing effort. Increased motorization combined with a substantial growth in overall vessel numbers were the drivers of the increasing fishing effort and decreasing CPUE, and clearly suggest that continuing to increase the fishing capacity of small-scale fisheries in the absence of effective and restrictive management actions may exacerbate overexploitation risk.},

  abstract = {Mangroves are critical nursery habitats for fish and invertebrates, providing livelihoods for many coastal communities. Despite their importance, there is currently no estimate of the number of fishers engaged in mangrove associated fisheries, nor of the fishing intensity associated with mangroves at a global scale. We address these gaps by developing a global model of mangrove associated fisher numbers and mangrove fishing intensity. To develop the model, we undertook a three-round Delphi process with mangrove fisheries experts to identify the key drivers of mangrove fishing intensity. We then developed a conceptual model of intensity of mangrove fishing using those factors identified both as being important and for which appropriate global data could be found or developed. These factors were non-urban population, distance to market, distance to mangroves and other fishing grounds, and storm events. By projecting this conceptual model using geospatial data\- sets, we were able to estimate the number and distribution of mangrove associated fishers and the intensity of fishing in mangroves. We estimate there are 4.1 million mangrove associated fishers globally, with the highest number of mangrove fishers found in Indonesia, India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Brazil. Mangrove fishing intensity was greatest throughout Asia, and to a lesser extent West and Central Africa, and Central and South America.},
